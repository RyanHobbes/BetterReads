Latin for Beginners (Language Guides),"Earn-lay atin-Lay? No, not that kind of Latin! You can learn true Latin, with conjugations, declensions, and all those extra syllables – and it’s easier than you think. In fact, most people mistakenly think of learning Latin as perhaps the most useless, tedious, and difficult thing to do on earth. They couldn’t be more wrong. Latin For Dummies takes you back for a quick jaunt through the parlance of ancient Rome, as well as discussing the progress of Latin into church language, and its status today as the “dead” language that lives on in English, Spanish, Italian, and most other Western tongues. Written for those with zero prior knowledge of Latin, this snappy guide puts the basics at your fingertips and steers clear of the arcane, schoolmarm stereotype of endless declensions and Herculean translations. Easy-to-understand sections describe: Latin you already know Grammar Pronunciation Latin in action Latin in law Latin in medicine Latin for impressing your friends And much more No dusty tome or other such artifact, Latin For Dummies makes learning fun and brings the language to life by presenting conversations in various Roman settings, as well as providing fun facts and stories about classical life. And if you feel you may actually have a negative aptitude for the language, don’t worry; pronunciations and translations follow every expression, and a helpful mini-dictionary graces the book’s last pages. You’ll also find out about: The quotable Roman Latin graffiti Latin authors who’s who Gladiator Latin Latin in love, marriage, and family From the mouth of Julius Caesar Romans on drink Helpful Latin-related Web sites Fun and games exercises Designed to introduce and familiarize you with the language rather than make you the next Cicero, Latin For Dummies gives you all the tools you need to work at your own pace to learn as much or as little as you like.

THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE,"Stephen King, Over leven en schrijven `Een meesterverteller.' VPRO Gids `Hoe doet King dat toch?' vroeg Joost Zwagerman zich al af in de Volkskrant. Hoe slaagt King er toch telkens weer in zijn lezers aan zich te binden en ze te verrassen? Hierover gaat Over leven en schrijven. Stephen King verhaalt over zijn jeugd, zijn puberjaren en zijn studietijd. Over de jaren na zijn doorbraak als schrijver, met Carrie, waarin succes en stress hem achtervolgen en de drank een uitvlucht biedt. Over het ongeluk dat hem in 1999 bijna het leven kost. En hoe hij er weer bovenop komt door zijn onweerstaanbare drang tot schrijven. Over wat hem inspireert en hoe hij te werk gaat. En natuurlijk laat King zijn licht schijnen over het belangrijkste wapen van elke schrijver: de pen die de auteur altijd in de aanslag moet hebben. Over leven en schrijven is een bron van inspiratie, voor zowel lezers als (aspirant-)schrijvers. Stephen King (1947) heeft meer dan tweehonderd verhalen op zijn naam staan, waaronder vijftig thriller- en fantasy-titels, alle wereldwijde bestsellers, waaronder Under the Dome (Gevangen), 22-11-1963, De Donkere Toren-reeks, Joyland,De Shining en Dr. Sleep.",['Stephen King'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UGEtDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UGEtDgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=THE+ELEMENTS+OF+STYLE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Luitingh Sijthoff,2013-10-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UGEtDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Copper Plate Photogravure: Demystifying the Process,"Copper Plate Photogravure describes in comprehensive detail the technique of traditional copper plate photogravure as would be practiced by visual artists using normally available facilities and materials. Attention is paid to step-by-step guidance through the many stages of the process. A detailed manual of technique, Copper Plate Photogravure also offers the history of the medium and reference to past alternative methods of practice. Copper Plate Photogravure: Demystifying the Process is part of the current revitalization of one of the most satisfyingly beautiful image-making processes. The range of ink color and paper quality possibilities is endless. The potential for handwork and alteration of the copper plate provides yet another realm of expressive variation. The subject matter and the treatment are as variable and broad as photography itself. This book's purpose is to demystify and clarify what is a complex but altogether ""do-able"" photomechanical process using currently available materials. With Copper Plate Photogravure, you will learn how to: · produce a full-scale film positive from a photographic negative · sensitize the gravure tissue to prepare it for exposure to the positive · prepare the plate and develop the gelatin resist prior to etching · prepare the various strengths of etching solutions and etch the plate to achieve a full tonal scale · rework the plate using printmaking tools to correct flaws or to adjust the image for aesthetic reasons · use the appropriate printing inks, ink additives, quality papers, and printshop equipment to produce a high quality print A historical survey and appendices of detailed technical information, charts, and tables are included, as well as a list of suppliers and sources for the materials required, some of which are highly specialized. A comprehensive glossary introduces the non-photographer or non-printmaker to many of the terms particular to those fields and associated with this process.","['David Morrish', 'Marlene MacCallum']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=viCoBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=viCoBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Copper+Plate+Photogravure:+Demystifying+the+Process&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,CRC Press,2003-04-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=viCoBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Photography'],

Penthouse March 1991,"Hector Crawford – the name remains synonymous with Australian television. The tag line ‘This has been a Crawford Production’ still resonates with generations of Australians who grew up with his cops, the Sullivan family or any of the long line of productions that flowed from his legendary company. His public façade is part of our collective memory but the man behind it, and how his passion and determination changed Australian culture forever is revealed in ‘Hector’. In this compelling account of his life Rozzi Bazzani recounts vividly how, as Crawford’s influence grew, the off screen politics employed by the TV networks and rivals to diminish his company’s power became as exciting as any of his onscreen dramas. ROZZI BAZZANI was a successful singer and studio artist for many years before she turned to writing full time. In addition to spending years of her life researching Hector and Dorothy Crawford’s lives, she co-wrote the musicals Gershwin, The Musical and The King of Corn, and hosted countless radio and TV programs. Ms Bazzani is a graduate of Melbourne University and lives in the Macedon Ranges in Victoria.

A new beginning,"This book is a postmodern analysis of Ronald Reagans 1984 film, A New Beginning, which marked the coming-of-age of the televisual political campaign film. The film was a landmark in the art of political filmmaking. Its thesis proclaimed a resurgence of American pride, patriotism, and prosperity under the leadership of Ronald Reagan. A New Beginning was unprecedented for a number of reasons: it replaced the traditional nominating speech for the candidate at the Republican National Convention; its form was a hybrid documentary and advertisement; it illustrated the use of televisual rebirth rhetoric to gain public support for a political ideology; and, most importantly, the masterful project documented a shift from verbal to visual rhetoric in American presidential campaigning. The author examines the film as a cultural text and as an effective political tool. Framing, ideology, myth, and visual cliché are analytic tools used to deconstruct the film; the method combines rhetorical theory with communication theory and semiotically-based theories of film and television. Morreale gives insight into the increasingly prevalent use of television to create a political reality.",['Joanne Morreale'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-h_c_VbOQXIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=-h_c_VbOQXIC&pg=PA2&dq=A+new+beginning&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,SUNY Press,1991-07-03,http://books.google.nl/books?id=-h_c_VbOQXIC&dq=A+new+beginning&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],

But for a man like the Babe, for whom the phrase “larger than life” seems to have been coined, those millions of words have created a mythologized legacy. Who was the real Babe Ruth? Relying on exhaustive research and interviews with teammates, family members, and friends, historian Robert W.

Beyond the Infinite: The Ascent to Dionysus,"Beyond the Infinite: The Ascent to Dionysus is the first fruit of what Bushashia calls the Post-Scientific Revolution. Bushashia opens with an attack on science's belief in cause and effect, while he puts forth his own anti-causal world-logic, which declares that the world is music. He seeks a world-understanding that not only comes to terms with time, but also fully embraces the becoming nature of actuality. Against both free will and scientific determinism, Bushashia is a fatalist, yet a fatalist who affirms the will-to-power. Against both conservatism and liberalism, Bushashia embarks upon a Dionysian view of life that includes belief in aristocracy. His book also includes new insights into the sublime and the beautiful, a spectacular interpretation of European history, and a strong critique of rationalism. All this is done instructively and with great clarity, making his work a very pleasant and delectable read.",['Adam Bushashia'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cUjMPAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cUjMPAAACAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Infinite:+The+Ascent+to+Dionysus&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Publishamerica Incorporated,2004-09,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cUjMPAAACAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Infinite:+The+Ascent+to+Dionysus&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],
Love Song (You're the One! (PB)),"In 1971, Newsweek heralded The Last Picture Show as the ""the most impressive work by a young American director since Citizen Kane."" Indeed, few filmmakers rivaled Peter Bogdanovich's popularity over the next decade. Riding the success of What's Up, Doc? (1972) and Paper Moon (1973), Bogdanovich became a bona fide celebrity, making regular appearances in his own movie trailers, occasionally hosting late-night television shows, and publicly advocating for mentors John Ford and Howard Hawks. No director of his era surpassed his ability to capture an audience's imagination. In Picturing Peter Bogdanovich: My Conversations with the New Hollywood Director, journalist and critic Peter Tonguette offers a film-by-film analysis of the director's life and work. Beginning with a string of 1970s classics, Tonguette explores well-known films such as Saint Jack (1979), They All Laughed (1981), and Noises Off (1992), as well as the director's work on stage and television. Drawing on interviews conducted over sixteen years, Tonguette pairs his analysis with an extensive, previously unpublished series of Q&As with Bogdanovich. These exclusive interviews reveal behind-the-scenes details about the director's life, work, and future plans. Part memoir, part critical biography, this book offers a uniquely intimate portrait of one of Hollywood's most underappreciated directors.",['Peter Tonguette'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BMzcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=BMzcDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA182&dq=Love+Song+(You%27re+the+One!+(PB))&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University Press of Kentucky,2020-06-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BMzcDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Performing Arts'],

Maar mag dat wel? Het liefst heeft Zach dat alles weer normaal is, want hij weet niet hoe hij met het verdriet van zijn ouders en met zijn eigen gevoelens moet omgaan. Hij wil dat zijn moeder er weer voor hem is, in plaats van dat ze alleen maar met de dader bezig is. En hij wil dat zijn vader naar hem kijkt en niet dag in dag uit naar buiten staart.

The Letter Writer,"This study argues for new perspectives on the letters of Paul, especially the Second Letter to Timothy. It examines striking aspects of Paul's letters, especially the fact that many of them are co-authored, that six of them acknowledge that a secretary has penned the letter, and that 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus are the only ones addressed to individuals. It investigates the implications of these facts for the concept of Pauline authorship. Prior maintains that the received arguments, statistical as well as literary, which exclude 2 Timothy from the influence of Paul, are less than convincing. The author suggests an original reading of 2 Timothy arguing it was composed by Paul towards the end of his first Roman imprisonment. Contrary to all interpretations of the letter which argue that Paul was about to be martyred, Prior claims that Paul was confident that he would be released, and was assembling a mission team to bring his proclamation of the Gospel to a completion. Timothy's courage and missionary zeal needed rekindling, for he and Mark were to be key figures in this new team.",['Michael Prior'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ntnUAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ntnUAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Letter+Writer&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,A&C Black,1989-01-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ntnUAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Letter+Writer&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Bible'],
Portraits from Memory and Other Essays,"‘I have come to think that one of the main causes of trouble in the world is dogmatic and fanatical belief in some doctrine for which there is no adequate evidence.’ – Bertrand Russell, Portraits from Memory Portraits from Memory is one of Bertrand Russell’s most self-reflective and engaging books. Whilst not intended as an autobiography, it is a vivid recollection of some of his celebrated contemporaries, such as George Bernard Shaw, Sidney and Beatrice Webb and D. H. Lawrence. Russell provides some arresting and sometimes amusing insights into writers with whom he corresponded. He was fascinated by Joseph Conrad, with whom he formed a strong emotional bond, writing that his Heart of Darkness was not just a story but an expression of Conrad’s ‘philosophy of life’. There are also some typically pithy Russellian observations; H. G. Wells ‘derived his importance from quantity rather than quality’, whilst after a brief and fraught friendship Russell thought D. H. Lawrence ‘had no real wish to make the world better, but only to indulge in eloquent soliloquy about how bad it was’. This engaging book also includes some of Russell’s customary razor-sharp essays on a rich array of subjects, from his ardent pacifism, liberal politics and morality to the ethics of education, the skills of good writing and how he came to philosophy as a young man. These include ‘A Plea for Clear Thinking’, ‘A Philosophy for Our Time’ and ‘How I Write’. Portraits from Memory is Russell at his best and will enthrall those new to Russell as well as those already well-acquainted with his work. This Routledge Classics edition includes a new foreword by the Russell scholar Nicholas Griffin, editor of The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell.",['Bertrand Russell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bBMHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=bBMHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Portraits+from+Memory+and+Other+Essays&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2020-11-29,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bBMHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],1.0

Swinging for the Fences: Black Baseball in Minnesota,"From the early formation of barnstorming teams that toured the state to the moment Dave Winfield hit number three thousand, Minnesota's African American ball players have made the state a land of baseball. However, the stories of many black players parallel the larger struggle for civil rights. Those tales, collected here for the first time, show how teamwork on and off the field led first to acceptance, then to admiration and triumph. Swinging for the Fences is the first collection to highlight the thrilling and controversial landmarks in the history of black baseball in the North Star State. Award-winning author Steven R. Hoffbeck assembled a stellar team of writers--and baseball fanatics--to tell the great stories of black baseball's past, from establishment of the color lines to dazzling hits by black heroes that led the Twins to victory over the Cardinals in '87. Each chapter focuses on one key player, and through these windows into their lives and livelihoods, their plays and passions, readers get an intimate look at the national pastime as it has evolved over the last century and more. Featured here are Hall of Famers like Willie Mays, Roy Campanella, and Kirby Puckett and great players like Walter Ball, John Wesley Donaldson, and Bud Fowler, who, because of their race, never made the stats books. These are stories of the bonds that formed between players, of legendary moments in baseball's past, and of real people whose love of the game kept them playing against tough odds.",['Steven R.

Beyond By Reason of Childhood,"Come along for the ride as the less-than-intrepid, insecure author Francis ""Frank"" J. Connelly picks up where By Reason of Childhood left off-walking down life's highway, represented by Cortelyou Road in Brooklyn, New York. Beyond by Reason of Childhood begins with Connelly en route to the U.S. Army induction center on Whitehall Street. From there, it's merely a series of hops, skips, and jumps to Fort Dix, New Jersey, for basic training; Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, for Morse Code Intercept Operator training; and on to the mountains, valleys, and rice paddies of South Korea. Fourteen months later, after an honorable discharge from the military, Frank meets Anne Marie Fleming. The couple marry, and, as time slips away, they find themselves being compared to a five-and-dime (for their five children and ten grandchildren). Along the way, Connelly works at various jobs: hauling cable for Western Electric, growing hair for Wybrandt Hair and Scalp Specialists, and spending twenty years on the New York Police Department. Near the end of his career in law enforcement, mental and physical difficulties and the debilitating effects of hypoglycemia take their toll on Connelly.

Murder by Injection: The Story of the Medical Conspiracy against America,"T he present work, the result of some forty years of investigative research, is a logical progression from my previous books: the expose of the international control of monetary issue and banking practices in the United States; a later work revealing the secret network of organizations through which these alien forces wield political power-the secret committees, foundations, and political parties through which their hidden plans are implemented; and now; to the most vital issue of all, the manner in which these depredations affect the daily lives and health of American citizens. Despite the great power of the hidden rulers, I found that only one group has the power to issue life or death sentences to any American-our nation's physicians. I discovered that these physicians, despite their great power, were themselves subjected to very strict controls over every aspect of their professional lives. These controls, surprisingly enough, were not wielded by any state or federal agency, although almost every other aspect of American life is now under the absolute control of the bureaucracy. The physicians have their own autocracy, a private trade association, the American Medical Association. This group, which is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, had gradually built up its power until it assumed total control over medical schools and the accreditation of physicians. The trail of these manipulators led me straight to the same lairs of the international conspirators whom I had exposed in previous books. I knew that they had already looted America, reduced its military power to a dangerously low level, and imposed bureaucratic controls on every American. I now discovered that their conspiracies also directly affected the health of every American. This conspiracy has resulted in a documented decline in the health of our citizens. We now rank far down the list of civilized nations in infant mortality and other significant medical statistics. I was able to document the shocking record of these cold-blooded tycoons who not only plan and carry out famines, economic depressions, revolutions and wars, but who also find their greatest profits in their manipulations of our medical care. The cynicism and malice of these conspirators is something beyond the imagination of most Americans. They deliberately mulct our people of millions of dollars each year through ''charitable'' organizations and then use these same organizations as key groups to bolster their Medical Monopoly. Fear and intimidation are the basic techniques by which the conspirators maintain their control over all aspects of our health care, as they ruthlessly crush any competitor who challenges their profits. As in other aspects of their ''behavioural control'' over the American people, their most constantly used weapon against us is their employment of federal agents and federal agencies to carry out their intrigues. The proof of this operation may be the most disturbing revelation of my work.",['Eustace Clarence Mullins'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WFzLjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=WFzLjwEACAAJ&dq=Murder+by+Injection:+The+Story+of+the+Medical+Conspiracy+against+America&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2016-04-21,http://books.google.nl/books?id=WFzLjwEACAAJ&dq=Murder+by+Injection:+The+Story+of+the+Medical+Conspiracy+against+America&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Medical'],1.0

Schilling: From a Study in Lost Time,"Dating from World War I to his painful demise in the late 1940s, this book chronicles the life of rural Louisianan Dr. Schilling in elegant, mesmerizing prose. Guillory, who has taught English at several American universities, uses the perspectives of Schilling and his sister, sons, and wife to reveal how and why one family fell apart. Schilling is disturbed by familial hostility, the deaths of his sister and one son, and his memories of Eustache, a lovely young woman with whom he was infatuated. To save her from a prison sentence for murdering her abusive husband, Schilling testifies that she is insane. Consequently, Eustache is committed to a mental hospital, but later Schilling and the reader learn that she is neither guilty nor insane. Ironically, the old doctor who had given his heart to his patients finds himself dying an agonizing death of heart disease, entirely dependent on morphine and his resentful wife to survive.

THE STARS ARE YOURS,"This book explores Basil Bunting’s continued reputation and influence in modern British poetry, and also the impact of a peculiarly ‘Northern’ inflection of Modernism (which Bunting largely defined) within the varieties of poetry being written in Britain today. The editors asked a variety of English, Scottish, Welsh and American poets and academics to reflect upon the themes, implications, impact or example of Bunting’s work in the centenary year of his birth, looking back on the beginnings of Modernism at the start of the twentieth century into which he was born, or forward into the twenty-first century in which he continues to be read and learned from: a true poetic star to steer by. The resulting collection of fourteen new essays reveals the continued ability of Bunting’s poetry both to delight and to challenge. Topics covered include the nature of influence; Celtic and Northumbrian contexts for the modern English long poem; prosodic patterns in early Bunting; Bunting as a reader of his own work; narrative sources in his poetry; the problem of patronage; his ‘rueful masculinity’; women poets and Bunting; radical landscape poetry; his translations from the Persian Hafiz and the Roman Horace; economic and social tensions in his work; the poet as ‘makar’; and a previously unpublished selection of his letters from the 1960s to the 1980s, commenting upon his own and others’ poetry and on the political condition of Britain in those years. The collection will be of interest to teachers and readers of twentieth century English and American poetry, and to those exploring the processes of literary translation. Contributors include David Annwn, Richard Caddel, Roy Fisher, Victoria Forde, Harry Gilonis, Ian Gregson, Philip Hobsbaum, Parvin Loloi, James McGonigal, Richard Price, Glynn Pursglove, Harriet Tarlo, Gael Turnbull, and Jonathan Williams.",,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6tFKEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6tFKEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA174&dq=THE+STARS+ARE+YOURS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,BRILL,2021-10-18,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6tFKEAAAQBAJ&dq=THE+STARS+ARE+YOURS&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

A Woman's Odyssey Into Africa: Tracks Across a Life (Haworth Women's Studies),"Here is the intriguing story of one woman’s mid-life flight from her stultified, middle-class, psychologically crippling, and unfulfilled existence into a world of high adventure, danger, hardship, and endurance, which ultimately leads her to autonomy and recognition. In her new book, A Woman’s Odyssey Into Africa, Hanny Lightfoot-Klein chronicles three year-long solo backpacking treks through remote areas of sub-Saharan Africa. In the process, she discovers the mainsprings of strength within herself as she follows her own drummer, finding the courage to face the darkest and most secret convolutions of her own mind. She weaves the story of her journey through the men, women, and children she meets, and the dangers and adventures she faces as a lone woman traveler--part and parcel of the path she has chosen to take. She infuses readers at any stage of life, especially women, with the courage to do what their individual drummer dictates, as she did, to find fulfillment in life. Lightfoot-Klein assures readers in her book: “Even a life of quiet desperation is not beyond redemption. Change starts with a reassessment of the distortions in self image one has been programmed to accept. It starts with an inner rebellion, a realization that something has been amiss and a desire to set it right, if only to leave a better heritage for one’s children. And then, most important of all, it begins with a single, wild, breathless moment, where one picks up an unaccustomed load and steps off into the unknown . . . ” Her message is truly for everyone.","['Hanny Lightfoot Klein', 'Ellen Cole', 'Esther D Rothblum']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RtfYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=RtfYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Woman%27s+Odyssey+Into+Africa:+Tracks+Across+a+Life+(Haworth+Women%27s+Studies)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2020-03-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RtfYDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],

Its central hypothesis, that we live in conflict with ourselves and seek to resolve matters by turning away from reality, did not emerge from experimental science but from self-examination and the unique opportunities for observation presented by the psychoanalytic technique - in particular, from the confessions produced by ‘free-association’ in Freud’s consulting room.

Meeting Across the River,"Bruce Springsteen's melancholy ""Meeting Across the River,"" a song rarely performed but beloved by his countless fans, serves as the inspiration for this eclectic mix of short stories written by an array of acclaimed authors. ""Meeting Across the River,"" from Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run album, is a song with an evocative melody and lyrics that unfold like a noir fable: a man down on his luck but desperate to make things right with his girl tells his buddy, Eddie, that they have to get across the river for a last-chance meeting with someone, all in the hopes of a big score: two grand. With that money, our hero can win back his girl and all will be right with the world-but if he and Eddie screw up, the consequences will be grave. Authors including Eric Garcia, C. J. Box, Barbara Seranella, David Corbett, Gregg Hurwitz, and Steve Hamilton, among others, have written imaginative, heartbreaking, funny, and bold stories based on this classic American story of hope and despair, each a surprisingly different experiment with character and plot. For as familiar as this story is, Springsteen's spare lyrics leave much unsaid. How these authors fill in the absences is what makes this collection, published a month before the thirtieth anniversary of the release of Springsteen's Born to Run, such an unusual treasure, proving that, just as with music, in literature no two performances are alike. Jessica Kaye is a publishing law attorney, occasional writer and the founder and former publisher of the Publishing Mills, an award-winning audiobook company, as well as a lifelong fan of great music and great writing. Richard J. Brewer is an author, actor, and voice-over talent for films and audiobooks.","['Jessica Kaye', 'Richard Brewer']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8uv4C6LBJ1wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=8uv4C6LBJ1wC&dq=Meeting+Across+the+River&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2008-12-04,http://books.google.nl/books?id=8uv4C6LBJ1wC&dq=Meeting+Across+the+River&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

Our Fathers' War: Growing Up In The Shadow Of The Greatest Generation,"A powerful and unique portrait of generational strife and changing styles of masculinity as seen through the stories of ten World War II veterans and their baby boomer sons. It is fair to say that Tom Mathews’s relations with his father, a veteran of World War II’s fabled 10th Mountain Division, were terrible. He came back from the war to a young son he’d barely met and proceeded to bully and browbeat him—for his own good, he thought. In the course of puzzling out almost fifty years of intermittent conflict, Mathews came to understand that their problems were not simply personal, they were generational—and widely shared by millions of other baby boomer sons. And so, to write this powerful book, which traces the kinetic effect of the war on the men who fought it, their sons, and their grandsons, Mathews has uncovered nine other dramatic and telling father-son tales of veterans in some ways missing in action and how internal war wounds shaped their lives as fathers. These include a combat infantryman whose life was saved by the fabled Audie Murphy, and a black member of the storied Tuskegee Airmen corps. In a moving final chapter, he and his father return together to Italy to revisit scenes from the war—and attempt, at long last, to forge their own separate peace. In a very real sense, Our Fathers’ War tells the secret history of World War II and its echoes down the years and generations. In the course of doing so, it offers a portrait of evolving styles of American manhood that many, many fathers and sons have been needing and awaiting.",['Tom Mathews'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c1KPx8fXGPwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=c1KPx8fXGPwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Our+Fathers%27+War:+Growing+Up+In+The+Shadow+Of+The+Greatest+Generation&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crown,2005-05-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c1KPx8fXGPwC&source=gbs_api,['History'],

The Survivor's Guide : An Orderly Step-By-Step Workbook to Pass on Your Personal Wishes and Financial Profile to Your Beneficiaries and Executor,"'Verplicht leesvoer voor iedereen die het allerbeste uit zichzelf wil halen.' — Kim Hubbard, auteur van People Heb je dat wel eens – dat je na een zenuwslopende uitdaging meteen verlangt naar een herkansing? Misschien na een sollicitatiegesprek, een optreden of een lastige presentatie? Juist op momenten die authenticiteit en kracht van je vragen, kun je je onecht en krachteloos voelen. En kun je daarna jezelf allerlei verwijten maken en er nog jarenlang met spijt op terugkijken. Amy Cuddy heeft miljoenen kijkers in vervoering gebracht met haar TED-talk over ‘power poses’. Nu geeft ze ons de intrigerende wetenschappelijke feiten. Ze leert ons eenvoudige technieken die ons helpen om los te komen van angst op spannende momenten en het beste uit onszelf te halen. Presence kenmerkt zich door een stevige wetenschappelijke onderbouwing die op een toegankelijke manier wordt gebracht door een gepassioneerde auteur. Het boek staat vol persoonlijke verhalen van mensen die ooit in de greep waren van angst maar dankzij de adviezen van Cuddy tijdens spannende momenten (weer) een beroep kunnen doen op hun persoonlijke kracht. Amy Cuddy liep op 19-jarige leeftijd ernstig hoofdletsel op. Medici betwijfelden of ze ooit haar mentale capaciteit terug zou krijgen en haar opleiding af zou kunnen maken. Inmiddels is zij sociaal psycholoog, professor en onderzoeker op Harvard Business School. Zij imponeerde in 2012 kijkers over de hele wereld met haar ted-talk over ‘power poses’, die nog steeds in de top-drie van meest bekeken ted-talks aller tijden staat. 'Cuddy legt een hartverwarmende bescheidenheid aan de dag. Haar eigen ""presence"" – haar hartsverlangen om de onzekeren en twijfelaars onder ons te helpen in dit tijdperk van angst – is voelbaar op iedere bladzijde. Presence is concreet én inspirerend, eenvoudig én ambitieus. Maar boven alles: heel krachtig.' — New York Times 'Amy Cuddy maakt de wereld moediger met haar boek. Moed is op een goede manier besmettelijk en presentie zet aan tot presentie. Ze wisselt wetenschap, praktijkvoorbeelden en individuele verhalen af om duidelijk te maken hoe we in uitdagende situaties ons moedigste, meest authentieke zelf kunnen aanspreken en anderen kunnen uitnodigen om hetzelfde te doen. Dit boek is een game-changer!' — Brene Brown",['Amy Cuddy'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c9h1CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=c9h1CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Survivor%27s+Guide+:+An+Orderly+Step-By-Step+Workbook+to+Pass+on+Your+Personal+Wishes+and+Financial+Profile+to+Your+Beneficiaries+and+Executor&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Spectrum,2016-02-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c9h1CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],
"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","""There are those already planning this afternoon's trip to the bookstore. Their only reaction is: Thank god, Patrick O'Brian is still writing. To you, I say, not a moment to lose.""—John Balzar, Los Angeles Times Life ashore may once again be the undoing of Jack Aubrey in The Yellow Admiral, Patrick O'Brian's best-selling novel and eighteenth volume in the Aubrey/Maturin series. Aubrey, now a considerable though impoverished landowner, has dimmed his prospects at the Admiralty by his erratic voting as a Member of Parliament; he is feuding with his neighbor, a man with strong Navy connections who wants to enclose the common land between their estates; he is on even worse terms with his wife, Sophie, whose mother has ferreted out a most damaging trove of old personal letters. Even Jack's exploits at sea turn sour: in the storm waters off Brest he captures a French privateer laden with gold and ivory, but this at the expense of missing a signal and deserting his post. Worst of all, in the spring of 1814, peace breaks out, and this feeds into Jack's private fears for his career. Fortunately, Jack is not left to his own devices. Stephen Maturin returns from a mission in France with the news that the Chileans, to secure their independence, require a navy, and the service of English officers. Jack is savoring this apparent reprieve for his career, as well as Sophie's forgiveness, when he receives an urgent dispatch ordering him to Gibraltar: Napoleon has escaped from Elba.","[""Patrick O'Brian""]",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gaOv-ckyG9wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gaOv-ckyG9wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Yellow+Admiral:+Aubrey/Maturin+Series,+Book+18&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",W.

Some Survive,"This true account by a WWII veteran taken prisoner by the Japanese “shows that the human spirit can soar like an eagle from the depths of hell on earth” (The Post and Courier, Charleston, South Carolina). Manny Lawton was a twenty-three-year-old army captain on April 8, 1942, when orders to surrender to the Japanese forces invading the Philippines arrived. The next day, he and his fellow American and Filipino prisoners set out on the infamous Bataan Death March—a forced six-day, sixty-mile trek under a broiling tropical sun during which approximately eleven thousand men died or were bayoneted, clubbed, or shot to death by the Japanese. As terrible as the Death March was, for Manny Lawton and his comrades it was only the beginning. When the war ended in August 1945, it is estimated that some fifty-seven percent of the American troops who had surrendered on Bataan had perished. Yet this is not a chronicle of despair. It is, instead, the story of how men can suffer even the most desperate conditions and, in their will to retain their humanity, triumph over appalling adversity. An epic of quiet heroism with an introduction by historian John Toland, Some Survived is a harrowing and inspiring tale—and “an honorable and absorbing testament to the courage of many” (The State).",['Manny Lawton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fzb08VXovkAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=fzb08VXovkAC&pg=PT179&dq=Some+Survive&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Algonquin Books,2004-01-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fzb08VXovkAC&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0

And I Will Dwell in Their Midst: Orthodox Jews in Suburbia,"Suburbia may not seem like much of a place to pioneer, but for young, religiously committed Jewish families, it's open territory."" This sentiment--expressed in the early 1970s by an Orthodox Jew in suburban Toronto--captures the essence of the suburban Orthodox Jewish experience of the late twentieth century. Although rarely associated with postwar suburbia, Orthodox Jews in metropolitan areas across the United States and Canada have successfully combined suburban lifestyles and the culture of consumerism with a strong sense of religious traditionalism and community cohesion. By their very existence in suburbia, argues Etan Diamond, Orthodox Jewish communities challenge dominant assumptions about society and religious culture in the twentieth century. Using the history of Orthodox Jewish suburbanization in Toronto, Diamond explores the different components of the North American suburban Orthodox Jewish community: sacred spaces, synagogues, schools, kosher homes, and social networks. In a larger sense, though, his book tells a story of how traditionalist religious communities have thrived in the most secular of environments. In so doing, it pushes our current understanding of cities and suburbs and their religious communities in new directions.",['Etan Diamond'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ra_qCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ra_qCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=And+I+Will+Dwell+in+Their+Midst:+Orthodox+Jews+in+Suburbia&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Univ of North Carolina Press,2000-10-30,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ra_qCQAAQBAJ&dq=And+I+Will+Dwell+in+Their+Midst:+Orthodox+Jews+in+Suburbia&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],
Fighting Words: An Illustrated History Of Newspaper Accounts Of The Civil War,"A Press Divided provides new insights regarding the sharp political divisions that existed among the newspapers of the Civil War era. These newspapers were divided between North and South, and also divided within the North and South. These divisions reflected and exacerbated the conflicts in political thought that caused the Civil War and the political and ideological battles within the Union and the Confederacy about how to pursue the war. In the North, dissenting voices alarmed the Lincoln administration to such a degree that draconian measures were taken to suppress dissenting newspapers and editors, while in the South, the Confederate government held to its fundamental belief in freedom of speech and was more tolerant of political attacks in the press. This volume consists of eighteen chapters on subjects including newspaper coverage of the rise of Lincoln, press reports on George Armstrong Custer, Confederate women war correspondents, Civil War photojournalists, newspaper coverage of the Emancipation Proclamation, and the suppression of the dissident press. This book tells the story of a divided press before and during the Civil War, discussing the roles played by newspapers in splitting the nation, newspaper coverage of the war, and the responses by the Union and Confederate administrations to press criticism.",['David B.

Light of the Night: The Last Eighteen Months in the Life of Th'r'se of Lisieux,"Thérèse of Lisieux died on 30 September 1897. Nine months later, the now classic Story of a Soul appeared and proved an immediate success. However, when historians had access fifty years later to manuscripts written by Thérèse they were surprised to discover enormous differences between these texts and the published version of Story of a Soul. Jean-François Six has written this new book with two purposes. First, he recalls the history of how Mother Agnés, Prioress of the Carmelite convent and sister of Thérèse altered and completed Thérèse's text so that it became a travesty of the original. Secondly he re-establishes the truth of the last months of Thérèse's life, her authentic spiritual message, and her contribution to the history of mysticism. In working on his book, Jean-François Six has relied on texts which can definitively be said to come from the hand of Thrérèse. In contrast to the sentimentality which is so often associated with her, he has found a powerful, lively figure, full of humor even in the depths of the spiritual night she experienced during her last months-the spiritual night which others have tried to deny or minimize.",['Jean-François Six'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cMcIAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cMcIAAAACAAJ&dq=Light+of+the+Night:+The+Last+Eighteen+Months+in+the+Life+of+Th%27r%27se+of+Lisieux&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1996,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cMcIAAAACAAJ&dq=Light+of+the+Night:+The+Last+Eighteen+Months+in+the+Life+of+Th%27r%27se+of+Lisieux&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

The Reichstag fire,"On the 27th of February 1933 the Reichstag fire was set on fire. Within the burning building a Dutchman going by the name of Marinus van der Lubbe was arrested for the arson. The Nazi-party, at that time the biggest party in the German Parliament, claimed that the communists were behind the fire and were trying to topple the government. At the same time the Communist Party claimed that the Nazi s had staged the fire in order to create a pretext for them to crack down hard on their (political) enemies. Marinus van der Lubbe was executed after stating in court that he worked alone. The consensus in Europe was that the Nazi s had staged the fire for their own political gain. After the Second World War a lively debate sprung up on whether or not Marinus van der Lubbe had received help from the Nazi s or had he worked alone. Up to the present day this debate is ongoing.

Blessing Same-Sex Unions: The Perils of Queer Romance and the Confusions of Christian Marriage,"At most church weddings, the person presiding over the ritual is not a priest or a pastor, but the wedding planner, followed by the photographer, the florist, and the caterer. And in this day and age, more wedding theology is supplied by Modern Bride magazine or reality television than by any of the Christian treatises on holy matrimony. Indeed, church weddings have strayed long and far from distinctly Christian aspirations. The costumes and gestures might still be right, but the intentions are hardly religious. Why then, asks noted gay commentator Mark D. Jordan, are so many churches vehemently opposed to blessing same-sex unions? In this incisive work, Jordan shows how carefully selected ideals of Christian marriage have come to dominate recent debates over same-sex unions. Opponents of gay marriage, he reveals, too often confuse simplified ideals of matrimony with historical facts. They suppose, for instance, that there has been a stable Christian tradition of marriage across millennia, when in reality Christians have quarreled among themselves for centuries about even the most basic elements of marital theology, authorizing experiments like polygamy and divorce. Jordan also argues that no matter what the courts do, Christian churches will have to decide for themselves whether to bless same-sex unions. No civil compromise can settle the religious questions surrounding gay marriage. And queer Christians, he contends, will have to discover for themselves what they really want out of marriage. If they are not just after legal recognition as a couple or a place at the social table, do they really seek the blessing of God? Or just the garish melodrama of a white wedding? Posing trenchant questions such as these, Blessing Same-Sex Unions will be a must-read for both sides of the debate over gay marriage in America today.",['Mark D.

In these pages you will learn about the fundamentals of the sport and gain insight into some of the greatest professional knife throwers–the men who paved the way for the modern day thrower."" — Bobby Branton, President of the American Knife Thrower's Alliance (AKTA) Harry McEvoy, foremost expert in the field of tomahawk and knife throwing and best-selling author of Knife Throwing: A Practical Guide, provides us with an exciting, in-depth look at the popular sport of weapon throwing. Meet the men who throw flaming knives at lovely ladies on a spinning target—and not scorch a hair; learn about the legendary ""Skeeter"" Vaughan, whose record-breaking throw saved the lives of hundreds of U.S. servicemen during World War II; and witness the courage of Tony Cascarella, who brought down a 275-pound wild boar with only three Bowie-Axe throwing knives. In addition, this book will clearly show you the skills involved in knife and tomahawk throwing—skills all the professionals first mastered before attempting the daring feats required when performing the ""impalement arts."" Also presented is an interesting history of throwing-knives, from the earliest times, through the development of the European daggers, and up to the knives used during the Vietnam War. Furthermore, you'll learn about many of the other throwing weapons of the world, including the martial arts weapons used by the Japanese ninja, and the deadly boomerangs of the Australian aborigines. Concisely written and illustrated with more than 50 photographs—including many of the ""greats"" in action—Knife and Tomahawk Throwing is a must for anyone interested in these fascinating sports.

His denial of drunkenness in the wake of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit should stop us in our tracks. What was going on here? How did the apostles experience the Holy Spirit? What was he teaching them? How was he empowering them? What does this scene in the streets of Jerusalem mean for us today? Father Raniero Cantalamessa offers pastoral advice and leads the reader through passages of Scripture and the Fathers of the Church to remind us of the incalculable power of the Spirit available to us. This spiritual ""intoxication"" is an infilling—through the sacraments, especially the Eucharist, and the action of God—that purifies us of sin, renews the heart and enlightens the mind. As St. Augustine said of the Spirit, ""He found you empty and he filled you…I like this kind of intoxication. The Spirit of God is both drink and light.""","['Raniero Cantalamessa', 'Marsha Daigle-Williamson']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NI8cAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=NI8cAAAACAAJ&dq=Sober+Intoxication+of+the+Spirit:+Filled+With+the+Fullness+of+God&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Servant Publications,2005,http://books.google.nl/books?id=NI8cAAAACAAJ&dq=Sober+Intoxication+of+the+Spirit:+Filled+With+the+Fullness+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

Antietam: Essays on the 1862 Maryland Campaign,"The relative importance of Civil War campaigns is a matter for debate among historians and buffs alike. Gettysburg, Vicksburg, and Atlanta have their advocates. Gettysburg certainly maintains its hold on the popular imagination. More recently has come the suggestion that no single campaign or battle decided the war or even appreciably altered its direction. If any one battle was a dividing line, Antietam is a solid contender. In no other campaign were the political, diplomatic, and military elements aligned so favorably for the Confederacy. Yet Lee's retreat after the terrible battle in September 1862 changed everything. Great Britain had second thoughts about intervention; Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation; and Lee's army, while victorious on other fields, proved not to be unbeatable. Across the years, Antietam remains the worst one-day slaughter in American history. The ghastly losses in the Cornfield, the West Woods, and the Sunken Road still appall the reader. Lee's gamble against disaster and George McClellan's inexplicable refusal to press his advantage remain puzzlements.",['Gary W.

In doing so, he also offers a lucid summary of his own philosophical thought.

Inside the Revolution: Everyday Life in Socialist Cuba (The Anthropology of Contemporary Issues),"The first ethnographic study of life in Cuba to emerge in over twenty years, Inside the Revolution offers a rare, close view of how socialist ideology translates into everyday experience in one Cuban municipality. Mona Rosendahl draws on eighteen months of fieldwork, in a municipality she calls by the fictional name Palmera, to present a vivid account of the lives and thoughts of residents, many of whom have lived inside the revolution for more than thirty-five years. In Palmera, support for the socialist program remains strong. Rosendahl attributes continuing loyalty to four conditions: improvements in the standard of living from 1959 to 1990, the uniformity and omnipresence of political communications from the government, a historical emphasis on local participation in the revolution, and the consistency of revolutionary ideals with traditional machista expectations and practices. Through an analysis of ideology and practice in contemporary Cuba, Rosendahl documents how its citizens support the present political system, and how reciprocal economics between households and ideas about gender both reinforce and challenge that system. Rosendahl also explains how those who oppose state socialism resist participation in society through inaction or withdrawal.",['Mona Rosendahl'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0VdukP4n6ncC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0VdukP4n6ncC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Inside+the+Revolution:+Everyday+Life+in+Socialist+Cuba+(The+Anthropology+of+Contemporary+Issues)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cornell University Press,1997,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0VdukP4n6ncC&dq=Inside+the+Revolution:+Everyday+Life+in+Socialist+Cuba+(The+Anthropology+of+Contemporary+Issues)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],

On Great White Wings: The Wright Brothers and the Race for Flight,"On the eve of the hundredth anniversary of the historic events at Kitty Hawk comes a splendidly illustrated account of the legendary twelve-second flight that changed the world forever. On December 17, 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright took to the air for less than a minute, accomplishing what mankind had only dreamed of for centuries. Now, almost one hundred years later, this definitive account offers a unique look at the Wright Brothers' achievement, and at the many experiments that led up to their momentous ride. Revealing the brothers' youthful interest in technology and flight, the authors recount the trials and errors of other would-be aviators, and explain how the race to be the first man aloft became an international obsession. Readers will learn how The Flyer -- the Wright Brothers' original plane -- was built, and how its indefatigable inventors solved the challenges that stumped their predecessors. And finally there is the historic flight itself -- what went wrong and what, amazingly, went right -- and the enormous impact the Wright Brothers had on their own and future generations. Written in engaging, accessible prose and, featuring more than 200 photographs and illustrations, On Great White Wings will delight anyone interested in the history of flight and in the fantastic story behind the twentieth century's most important achievement.",['Fred E.

The organization of the text, a collection of short prose meditations and poetry, embraces the motion and rhythm of moving water. Through his poetry and prose, Delp demonstrates the way one can literally build an inner landscape out of the places of water one frequents. Having grown up on water and embraced it as a part of his being, he writes passionately about existing rivers, lakes, and streams in Michigan, and uses powerful metaphors to keep these places thriving in the imagination. The collection concludes with ""What My Father Told Me"", a powerful prose piece in which Delp reflects on the wisdom his father shared with him about the magic of water and of life during their fishing outings.

Portraits of each residence--including the Vervoordts' own homes in Venice and Belgium--feature sweeping vistas of the surrounding landscape and a tour through the interiors.

Celtic Goddess (P),"Most people have heard of the Celts--the elusive, ancient tribal people who resided in present-day England, Ireland, Scotland and France. Paradoxically characterized as both barbaric and innocent, the Celts appeal to the modern world as a symbol of a bygone era, a world destroyed by the ambition of empire and the spread of Christianity throughout Western Europe. Despite the pervasive cultural and literary influence of the Celts, shockingly little is known of their way of life and beliefs, because very few records of their stories exist. In this book, for the first time, Philip Freeman brings together the best stories of Celtic mythology. Everyone today knows about the gods and heroes of the ancient Greeks, such as Zeus, Hera, and Hercules, but how many people have heard of the Gaulish god Lugus or the magical Welsh queen Rhiannon or the great Irish warrior Cú Chulainn? We still thrill to the story of the Trojan War, but the epic battles of the Irish Táin Bó Cuailgne are known only to a few. And yet those who have read the stories of Celtic myth and legend-among them writers like J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis-have been deeply moved and influenced by these amazing tales, for there is nothing in the world quite like them. In these stories a mysterious and invisible realm of gods and spirits exists alongside and sometimes crosses over into our own human world; fierce women warriors battle with kings and heroes, and even the rules of time and space can be suspended. Captured in vivid prose these shadowy figures-gods, goddesses, and heroes-come to life for the modern reader.",['Philip Freeman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9qL_DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9qL_DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Celtic+Goddess+(P)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,2017,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9qL_DQAAQBAJ&dq=Celtic+Goddess+(P)&hl=&source=gbs_api,"['Mythology, Celtic']",1.0

The Film Noir Bible: When White People Had the Blues,"""The Film Noir Bible is really an encyclopedia. Designed so you easily get into it. Yet, it also has depth. This truly massive book is crammed to the gills with extraordinary movies, endless characters, inspired quotes, and incendiary analysis. In one book, an entire era of films will come alive. I've tracked down all the highlights (like some rare, wild, nearly extinct beast, film noir has fi-nally been captured). If it's exciting, it's here. Nothing lame, nothing sloppy, nothing weak. It must be noted that some 50 years after the fact, film noir still remains shrouded in mystery. On the simplest level, many important films are unaccounted for (not to mention, numerous obscurities). In line with this, theories accounting for the phenomenon have been most unsatisfactory (thus some have dismissed the idea altogether). Yet, this hasn't stopped film noir from being acclaimed as the one true American 'art film' genre and as 'one of the most important cultural developments of the twentieth century'. However, noir hasn't been well-served in recent years by either the movies made in its name or the critical commentary on the subject. Now, The Film Noir Bible comes along to answer the question of whether film noir was a truly significant artistic movement or merely a bunch of mildly amusing relics which people still get a kick out of. The Film Noir Bible isn't about theory. It's about movies (I name names). I'll tell you what films are good, bad, underrated (I didn't watch all these films not to have an opinion on them). Have the movies dated? Are they flawed but interesting? All here. Plus, the book overflows with detailed descriptions of the many characters who people film noir. You won't see this in other books. Tons of unique quotes as well. All in all, it's a no-nonsense guide to the 200 or so most significant film noirs of all time (and more). When I'm thru with these sonuvabitches, you'll know them better than your next-door neighbor (in fact, you won't even need to watch the film to get a great feel for it).""--Amazon website.",['Wampa 12'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y7dTAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=y7dTAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Film+Noir+Bible:+When+White+People+Had+the+Blues&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2004-10-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=y7dTAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Film+Noir+Bible:+When+White+People+Had+the+Blues&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Performing Arts'],
The Viking-Age Rune-Stones: Custom and Commemoration in Early Medieval Scandinavia,"There are over 3000 runic inscriptions on stone made in Scandinavia in the late Viking Age. This book is the first attempt by a historian to study the material as a whole. The analysis reveals significant regional variations that reflect different stages in the process of conversion, and the growth of royal power. Many monuments were declarations of faith or manifestations of status; but virtually all reflect inheritance claims, and cast unexpected light on the prehistory of the inheritance customs found in later Scandinavian law codes. The results of this analysis make a significant contribution to understanding developments in other parts of the Germanic world, as well as Scandinavia. The inclusion of a digest of the data-base on which this book is based will facilitate further study of this rich vein of evidence.",['Birgit Sawyer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MMFisCY78DYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=MMFisCY78DYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Viking-Age+Rune-Stones:+Custom+and+Commemoration+in+Early+Medieval+Scandinavia&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,OUP Oxford,2000,http://books.google.nl/books?id=MMFisCY78DYC&dq=The+Viking-Age+Rune-Stones:+Custom+and+Commemoration+in+Early+Medieval+Scandinavia&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

"Health Law: Cases, Materials and Problems (American Casebook Series)","For more than two decades, Health Law: Cases, Materials and Problems has defined the field of health law, providing a balanced overview of law as it affects patients, professionals, institutions, and entities that deliver and finance U.S. health care. The 7th Edition of Health Law comprehensively reviews the provisions of the Affordable Care Act with topics such as the oversight of quality (including the latest developments in patient safety), cost control (including consumer-directed health care), guarantees of adequate access to services, exempt-organization tax issues, transactions and relationships among health care professionals and providers, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and malpractice litigation. The Supreme Court decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius is carefully edited to present all the issues in the case. Written without a policy bias to fairly reflect all viewpoints, the book considers legal and ethical issues involving death, human reproduction, medical treatment decision making, and medical research. It also explores the government's efforts to control costs and expand access through Medicare and Medicaid and examines government attempts to police anticompetitive activities, fraud, and abuse.

Myron Goldfinger Architect,"Inspired by his investigations into Mediterranean vernacular architecture, Myron Goldfinger has produced a significant body of work in the last twenty-five years which reflects his deep appreciation of the past - not in the sense of borrowing - but of reinterpreting those elements into a most sophisticated use of strong geometric form in building. This work represents architecture as sculpture in space, and these buildings have been situated on some of the most inspirational sites. The architecture ranges in scope from small dwellings to grand residences, from his early works to the present, including many recently completed projects - presented as a personal visual essay. His architecture is not for the meek. The designs are based on very sound function and present creative ideas and inventive use of architectural space within the bold exterior forms. His work is among the very finest of modern residential architecture.",['Myron Goldfinger'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fudPAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=fudPAAAAMAAJ&q=Myron+Goldfinger+Architect&dq=Myron+Goldfinger+Architect&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Rockport Pub,1992,http://books.google.nl/books?id=fudPAAAAMAAJ&dq=Myron+Goldfinger+Architect&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Architecture'],

Assassin,"In #1 New York Times bestselling author Vince Flynn’s explosive and “captivating” (Glenn Beck) thriller, witness the young Mitch Rapp as he takes on his first assignment. Mitch Rapp was a gifted college athlete without a care in the world…and then tragedy struck. Terrorists attacked innocent American citizens, and Rapp’s girlfriend was among the murdered. Two hundred and seventy souls perished on that cold December night, and thousands of family and friends were left searching for comfort. Mitch Rapp was one of them, but he was not interested in comfort. Now he wants retribution. Two decades of cutthroat partisan politics have left the CIA and the country in an increasingly vulnerable position. Cold War veteran CIA Operations Director Thomas Stansfield knows he must prepare his people for the next war. America must confront Islamic terrorism with full force. Stansfield directs his protégée, Irene Kennedy, and his old Cold War colleague, Stan Hurley, to form a new group of clandestine operatives who will work outside the normal chain of command—men who do not exist. What type of man is willing to kill for his country without putting on a uniform? Six months of intense training have prepared him to take the war to the enemy’s doorstep, and he does so with brutal efficiency. Rapp starts in Istanbul, where he assassinates the Turkish arms dealer who sold the explosives used in the terrorist attack. Rapp then moves on to Hamburg with his team and across Europe, leaving a trail of bodies. All roads lead to Beirut, though, and what Rapp doesn't know is that the enemy is aware of his existence and has prepared a trap. The hunter is about to become the hunted, and Rapp will need every ounce of skill and cunning if he is to survive the war-ravaged city and its various terrorist factions. This is “a bold and brawny tale that never wavers or lets up. The voice of today’s postmodern thriller generation, Flynn has never been better” (The Providence Journal) in this unforgettable novel of a young man primed to become an American assassin.",['Vince Flynn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TlpbWL6lHHUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=TlpbWL6lHHUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Assassin&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2010-10-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TlpbWL6lHHUC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],52.0

LAX: Los Angeles International Airport,"Growth on the flatlands along the western extents of Imperial Highway in the 1920s was once measured in beans, barley, and jackrabbits. After 2000, the site that became Los Angeles International Airport would be measured by the more than 60 million passengers and nearly two million tons of cargo passing through it each year. One of the world's busiest airports grew out of Mines Field and expanded quickly in the 1930s with the exploits of Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart, Howard Hughes and Will Rogers, Curtiss and Martin, and Boeing and Lockheed. After World War II, this large portion of coastal Los Angeles between El Segundo and Marina del Rey became the main airport for Greater Los Angeles. With the advent of the jet age in the town of the jet set, LAX became a nexus of international travel and a symbol of sophistication as the ""Gateway to the World,"" a cutting-edge center for the overlapping spheres of aviation, business, politics, and entertainment.","['William A.

How Holocausts Happen: The United States in Central America,"""History repeats itself, but it never repeats itself exactly,"" observes Douglas Porpora in this powerful indictment of U.S. intervention in Central America. Comparing the general public’s reaction to the Holocaust in Nazi Germany with American public opinion of U.S. participation in the genocidal policies of Nicaraguan counter-revolutionary forces, and the governments of Guatemala and El Salvador among others, Porpora demonstrates that moral indifference to the suffering of others was the common response. With reference to Hannah Arendt’s thesis of the banality of evil, he develops the concept of a ""Holocaust-like event"" and examines how even a democratic society can be capable of something on the order of a Holocaust. Unlike other accounts of the Holocaust and genocide, this book focuses on the citizenry served or ruled by genocidal governments rather than on the governments themselves. Porpora argues that moral indifference and lack of interest in critical reflection are key factors that enable Holocaust-like events to happen And he characterizes American society as being typically indifferent to the fate of other people, uninformed, and anti-intellectual. Porpora cites numerous horrifying examples of U.S.-backed Latin American government actions against their own peasants, Indians, and dissident factions. He offers finally a theory of public moral indifference and argues that although such indifference is socially created by government, the media, churches, and other institutions, we, the public, must ultimately take responsibility for it. How Holocausts Happen is at once a scholarly examination of the nature of genocide and a stinging indictment of American society.",['Douglas Porpora'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O8xaVnlyndYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=O8xaVnlyndYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=How+Holocausts+Happen:+The+United+States+in+Central+America&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Temple University Press,1992-02-24,http://books.google.nl/books?id=O8xaVnlyndYC&dq=How+Holocausts+Happen:+The+United+States+in+Central+America&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0

Turning The Tables: An Alex Peres Mystery (Alex Peres Mysteries),"Toen Het leven een gebruiksaanwijzing – door Italo Calvino geroemd als ‘de laatste grote gebeurtenis in de geschiedenis van de roman’ – in 1978 verscheen werd het direct bekroond met de Prix Médicis. En in 1995, het jaar waarin de Nederlandse vertaling voor het eerst verscheen, werd het door de verzamelde Vlaamse en Nederlandse kritiek uitgeroepen tot het beste boek van dat jaar. De roman is een magistraal literair vlechtwerk van de bizarre levensverhalen van bewoners in een groot oud flatgebouw in Parijs. Excentrieke miljonairs, croupiers, moordenaars, necrofiele schilders, televisieproducenten, danseressen, kamermeisjes en coureurs passeren de revue. Maar hoe uitzonderlijk die personages ook mogen zijn, het is de banale, nooit ondervraagde, alledaagse werkelijkheid die Perec op minutieuze wijze beschrijft en onder de loep neemt, en die deze roman zo bijzonder maakt. Dit is een boek van wanhoop, liefde en verraad, een ‘wonderbaarlijk compleet boek’ dat een heel nieuw beeld van de wereld geeft en geschreven is door een auteur die vaak in één adem genoemd wordt met literaire grootheden als Joyce, Nabokov en Borges.",['Georges Perec'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9O8mDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9O8mDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Turning+The+Tables:+An+Alex+Peres+Mystery+(Alex+Peres+Mysteries)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Singel Uitgeverijen,2017-06-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9O8mDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

In addition to including extraordinary works from well-known poets such as Bruce Weigl, Margaret Atwood, Yusef Komunyakaa, Sharon Olds, Robert Bly, Allen Ginsberg, Grace Paley, Philip Levine, and W. S. Merwin, editor Phillip Mahony has scoured the globe to find amazing and, in some cases, never-before-published poetry by North and South Vietnamese soldiers and poets and the first postwar generation of Vietnamese-Americans.

Spyworld,"""For twenty years Canada has been spying on other nations. Outside public scrutiny or Parliamentary review and frequently acting at the behest of U.S. and U.K. intelligence agencies. Canada has been spying electronically from its embassies in capitals as far-flung as Moscow, New Delhi, Bucharest, Rabat and Caracas. It has then shared the results with its allies. There is every reason to believe Canada is still doing ""embassy collection"" today. Techniques developed during the ""Cold War"" have been honed for political and economic espionage in the nineties."" ""The agency responsible is the top-secret Communications Security Establishment (CSE) of whose existence most Canadians are unaware. CSE has also used sophisticated equipment, much of it provided by the U.S., to listen in on Canadian and on American citizens, raising vital questions about civil liberties and the invasion of privacy. It has intercepted communications from the Soviet embassy in Ottawa; from British cabinet ministers; from the governments of France and Quebec; from suspected Sikh terrorists in India; and from the Kremlin. Its record is impressive: if it wants to, it can intercept almost any phone, fax or radiowave transmission."" ""How do we know all this? Because one man, Mike Frost, a communications officer at CSE for nineteen years, has decided that in the post-""Cold War"" era it is time for the Canadian public to be told what its government has been doing and for a public debate to ensue."" ""As he tells the story of his career, he paints a remarkable picture of the Security Establishments of Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. The Americans in particular are revealed as possessing high-tech wizardry that they use for political and economic spying - including, according to Frost, highly controversial spying on the Canadian government. Much of Canada's spying from 1972 to 1990 was undertaken for the Americans. Frost and his immediate boss were at the centre of the ""embassy-collection"" scheme, which was code-named ""Project Pilgrim"". The story of how ""Pilgrim"" grew by trial and error into a highly successful operation is full of drama, comedy, triumphs and frustrations."" ""Frost is proud of the achievements, but the questionable aspects of CSE's activities have led him to go public on both CSE's successes and its excesses. While scrupulously careful about not jeopardizing national security or endangering the lives of agents in the field, he nonetheless reveals an institution whose powers are potentially so great that they need to be subject to Parliamentary control and public scrutiny. Spyworld will undoubtedly spur debate and controversy.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

The Shunra and the Schmetterling,"Shunra is Aramaic for cat. Schmetterling is German for butterfly. In Yoel Hoffmann's new book, these and numerous other creatures, cultures, and languages meet in a magical shimmering hymn to childhood. Hoffmann traces his hero's developing consciousness of the ways-and-wonders of the world as though he were peering through a tremendous kaleidoscope: all that was perceived, all that is remembered, is rendered in fluid fragments of color and light. With remarkable delicacy and sweep, Hoffmann captures childhood from the amazed inside out, and without the backward-looking wash of grown-up sentiment. Instead, the boy's deadpan registration of the human comedy around him is offered up as strangely magical fact. Beautifully translated by Peter Cole, The Shunra & the Schmetterling is fiction for lovers of poetry and poetry for lovers of fiction--a small marvel of a book, and one of the author's finest to date.","['Yoel Hoffmann', 'Peter Cole']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mPxJfohF0mgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mPxJfohF0mgC&pg=PA3-IA1&dq=The+Shunra+and+the+Schmetterling&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,New Directions Publishing,2004,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mPxJfohF0mgC&dq=The+Shunra+and+the+Schmetterling&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

Jacques Derrida (Religion and Postmodernism),"Geoffrey Bennington sets out here to write a systematic account of the thought of Jacques Derrida. Responding to Bennington's text at every turn is Derrida's own excerpts from his life and thought that, appearing at the bottom of each page, resist circumscription. Together these texts, as a dialogue and a contest, constitute a remarkably in-depth, critical introduction to one of the leading philosophers of the twentieth century and, at the same time, demonstrate the illusions inherent in such a project. Bennington's account of Derrida, broader in scope than any previously done, leads the reader through the philosopher's familiar yet still widely misunderstood work on language and writing to the less familiar and altogether more mysterious themes of signature, sexual difference, law, and affirmation. Seeking to escape this systematic rendering - in fact, to prove it impossible - Derrida interweaves Bennington's text with surprising and disruptive ""periphrases"": reflections on his mother's death agony, commentaries on St. Augustine's Confessions, memories of childhood, remarks on Judaism, and references to his collaborator's efforts. This extraordinary book offers, on the one hand, a clear and compelling account of one of the most difficult and important contemporary thinkers and, on the other, one of that thinker's strangest and most unexpected texts. Far from putting an end to the need to discuss Derrida, Bennington's text might have originally intended or pretended, this dual text opens new dimensions in the philosopher's thought and work and extends its challenge.","['Geoffrey Bennington', 'Jacques Derrida']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MFZgdN20Gv0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=MFZgdN20Gv0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jacques+Derrida+(Religion+and+Postmodernism)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Chicago Press,1993,http://books.google.nl/books?id=MFZgdN20Gv0C&dq=Jacques+Derrida+(Religion+and+Postmodernism)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

The Freeway,"When the interstate highway program connected America’s cities, it also divided them, cutting through and destroying countless communities. Affluent and predominantly white residents fought back in a much heralded “freeway revolt,” saving such historic neighborhoods as Greenwich Village and New Orleans’s French Quarter. This book tells of the other revolt, a movement of creative opposition, commemoration, and preservation staged on behalf of the mostly minority urban neighborhoods that lacked the political and economic power to resist the onslaught of highway construction. Within the context of the larger historical forces of the 1960s and 1970s, Eric Avila maps the creative strategies devised by urban communities to document and protest the damage that highways wrought. The works of Chicanas and other women of color—from the commemorative poetry of Patricia Preciado Martin and Lorna Dee Cervantes to the fiction of Helena Maria Viramontes to the underpass murals of Judy Baca—expose highway construction as not only a racist but also a sexist enterprise. In colorful paintings, East Los Angeles artists such as David Botello, Carlos Almaraz, and Frank Romero satirize, criticize, and aestheticize the structure of the freeway. Local artists paint murals on the concrete piers of a highway interchange in San Diego’s Chicano Park. The Rondo Days Festival in St. Paul, Minnesota, and the Black Archives, History, and Research Foundation in the Overtown neighborhood of Miami preserve and celebrate the memories of historic African American communities lost to the freeway. Bringing such efforts to the fore in the story of the freeway revolt, The Folklore of the Freeway moves beyond a simplistic narrative of victimization. Losers, perhaps, in their fight against the freeway, the diverse communities at the center of the book nonetheless generate powerful cultural forces that shape our understanding of the urban landscape and influence the shifting priorities of contemporary urban policy.",['Eric Avila'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3y90DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=3y90DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT179&dq=The+Freeway&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,U of Minnesota Press,2014-05-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3y90DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Architecture'],

The making of Europe: An introduction to the history of European unity,"Christopher Dawson concludes that the period of the fourth to the eleventh centuries, commonly known as the Dark Ages, is not a barren prelude to the creative energy of the medieval world. Instead, he argues that it is better described as ""ages of dawn"" for it is in this rich and confused period that the complex and creative interaction of the Roman empire, the Christian Church, the classical tradition, and barbarous societies provided the foundation for a vital, unified European culture. In an age of fragmentation and the emergence of new nationalist forces, Dawson argued that if ""our civilization is to survive, it is essential that it should develop a common European consciousness and sense of historic and organic unity."" But he was clear that this unity required sources deeper and more complex than the political and economic movements on which so many had come to depend, and he insisted, prophetically, that Europe would need to recover its Christian roots if it was to survive. In a time of cultural and political ambiguity, The making of Europe is an indispensable work for understanding not only the rich sources but also the contemporary implications of the very idea of Europe.",['Christopher Dawson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a99zdvANyGkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=a99zdvANyGkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+making+of+Europe:+An+introduction+to+the+history+of+European+unity&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,CUA Press,2002,http://books.google.nl/books?id=a99zdvANyGkC&dq=The+making+of+Europe:+An+introduction+to+the+history+of+European+unity&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0

"No Lights, No Sirens: The Corruption and Redemption of an Inner City Cop","A New York Police Officer's relentless journey into the criminal netherworld, told with brutal truth and honesty. Perhaps Neitzsche described Rob Cea's life best, way before he was born: ""Take care when chasing the animals; for you can very well become the animal you are chasing."" No Lights, No Sirens is a sojourn so dirty and nasty it defies belief. Rob Cea starts off as an idealistic young cop, a true believer in the system for which he works tirelessly. He is sadly mistaken. The system he tried so hard to appease ultimately led to his downfall and the ruination of his life. What separates this from other cop—and—robber stories is the brutal authenticity from the cop himself. We will see and hear exactly what is discussed in a patrol car. We will see how the law was—and is—routinely bent to make collars stick any way possible. And we will see how Cea slowly spirals to depths of hell. No Lights, No Sirens is simplistic in its scope: A young idealistic boy becomes a man through fire, and then becomes exactly what he has been chasing for so long, a hardened man possessed by demons. With rapid fire and gritty narrative, Cea writes about his fall to the depths, and his salvation. We see the dark side of detective work in New York's most crime—riddled neighborhoods from a first-hand view never before seen.",['Robert Cea'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8sF2ETr8T4IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8sF2ETr8T4IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=No+Lights,+No+Sirens:+The+Corruption+and+Redemption+of+an+Inner+City+Cop&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Harper Collins,2012-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8sF2ETr8T4IC&source=gbs_api,['Law'],1.0

Teaching Company -- The History of Ancient Rome (The),"For twenty years, the Roman Empire conquered its way through modern-day Germany, claiming all lands from the Rhine to the Elbe. However, when at last all appeared to be under control, a catastrophe erupted that claimed the lives of 10,000 legionnaires and laid Romes imperial ambitions for Germania into the dust. In late September of 9 AD, three Roman legions, while marching to suppress a distant tribal rebellion, were attacked in a four-day battle with the Germanic barbarians. The Romans, under the leadership of the provinces governor, Publius Quinctilius Varus, were taken completely by surprise, betrayed by a member of their own ranks: the German officer and secret rebel leader, Arminius. The defeat was a heavy blow to both Romes military and its pride. Though the disaster was ruthlessly avenged soon afterwards, later attempts at conquering the Germans were half-hearted at best. Four days in September thoroughly examines the ancient sources and challenges the hypotheses of modern scholars to present a clear picture of the prelude to the battle, the fighting itself and its aftermath.",['Jason R.

The Writing of Yehuda Amichai: A Thematic Approach (Suny Series in Modern Jewish Literature and Culture),"Yehuda Amichai is an Israeli poet of international distinction. Known as Israels master poet, Amichai conveys a portrait of life in modern Israel, summarizing and reflecting all the major preoccupations of his generation. Unlike most of his Israeli contemporaries he explores the alteration of Jewish perspectives, the loss of religious orthodoxy and the nature of Jewish identity in the mid-20th century. He illuminates the dislocation of Jewish life after the Holocaust and the dilemma of response on the part of young Israelis. His poetic language is rich in figuration and laced with quotations from classical Jewish texts which he manipulates into ironic discourse with the problems of the present. Echoing the 17th-century metaphysical poets, Amichais writing reveals a tussle between physical love and spirituality; its tension lies in his failure to synthesize both in religious faith. Abramson presents a detailed critical description and thematic analysis of Amichais work, with reference to the historical background from which it has emerged. The problems of an emerging national culture are seen subjectively through the eyes of one of its most sensitive and perceptive literary observers.",['Glenda Abramson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2iFpXg2qM60C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=2iFpXg2qM60C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Writing+of+Yehuda+Amichai:+A+Thematic+Approach+(Suny+Series+in+Modern+Jewish+Literature+and+Culture)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,SUNY Press,2012-02-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2iFpXg2qM60C&source=gbs_api,['History'],

Speaking of Liberty,"Mises said that teaching the public was just as important as addressing scholars maybe more so.That is what Lew Rockwell specializes in: history and theory and analysis in defense of the free society, written in clear prose to reach a broad audience. Rockwells new book is as pro liberty as it is brutally critical of government. It is relentlessly forthright yet hopeful about the prospects for liberty. It is rigorous enough to withstand the enemys closest scrutiny, and chock full of the energy and enthusiasm that will keep you reading. As a collection of speeches delivered over a period of ten years, Speaking of Liberty is long (470 pages), but it is the kind of book people will want to see in the hands of friends, family, and students. The book begins with economics, and explains why Austrian economics matters, how the Federal Reserve brings on the business cycle, why we need private property and free enterprise, the unrecognized glories of the capitalist economy, and why the gold standard is still the best monetary system. The remaining sections deal with war, Mises and his work, other important thinkers in the libertarian tradition, and the culture and morality of liberty. The book is united by a set of fixed principles: the corruption of politics, the universality and immutability of the ideas of freedom, the centrality of sound money and free enterprise, the moral imperative of peace and trade, the importance of hope and tenacity in the struggle for liberty, and the need for everyone to join the intellectual fight. We all have searched for the book we could give to friends and neighbors, business associates and family members, to explain why we believe in the cause of liberty. Speaking of Liberty is that book. ""Critics of the free market are therefore the Wile E Coyotes of our day: sitting on the stool in comfort, they systematically saw away at the legs beneath them, on the absurd assumption that they will be able to hang in the air indefinitely after their work is done.

Het is 1852, en in Londen gaan twee jonge vrouwen aan boord van een schip dat hen naar het verre Nieuw-Zeeland en een betere toekomst moet brengen. De adellijke Gwyneira is een huwelijk met de zoon van een rijke landeigenaar beloofd, en ze hoopt met haar reis naar de andere kant van de wereld ook haar benauwende leven in Engeland te ontvluchten.

Surveying Fiberglass Sailboats: A Step-By-Step Guide for Buyers and Owners,"Since the late 1950s, when the first ""plastic"" sailboat shocked the New York Boat Show, fiberglass boatbuilding has gone through classic growing pains. Longtime yacht broker and marine surveyor Henry Mustin has seen it all: the slow acceptance of those early, heavy boats; the market boom of the lighter boats of the 1970s; the ""boat pox"" scare of the 1980s; and the continued lack of industry standards that makes buying and owning a fiberglass boat an adventure. In Surveying Fiberglass Sailboats Mustin explains what to watch for in a used sailboat from each era, and how to ferret out the hidden defects in any boat. He shows how to estimate the cost of repairs and the value of a boat. And he addresses the question: When is a fiberglass boat too used up to save? Mustin's part-by-part look at hull, deck, rig, and machinery is both a minicourse for transforming used-boat shopping from a game of craps to a science, and the first step in a holistic boat maintenance program. His discussion of the significance of cracks found in aging hulls and decks is the most thorough in print. He is not shy in assessing the lack of regulation of professional surveyors, nor does he shrink from pointing a finger at shoddy building practices. Having a used boat surveyed is a critical prelude to buying it. Yet a professional survey is expensive--several hundred dollars. Surveying Fiberglass Sailboats will enable you to conduct your own surveys while narrowing the field, then monitor a professional surveyor's performance when selecting your target boat. The inside story on surveying fiberglass boats. No sailor should be without it. Praise for Surveying Fiberglass Sailboats: ""A concisely written primer for sailors considering purchasing a used boat, preparing for extended cruising, or seeking guidelines for an ongoing maintenance program. . . . Mustin is adept at distilling often highly involved subjects, so you should be able to learn the fundamentals of evaluating a vessel's major structures, systems, and equipment.""--SAIL ""Thoroughly studying this book will enable you to inspect your own boat, identify problems and formulate an effective maintenance program. Plus, if you plan to buy either a used or new fiberglass sailboat, this book should help you reduce your cost.""--Ensign "". . . long-time professional boat surveyor Mustin shares his experience in a compact, easy-to-reference handbook . . . This slender volume provides the foundation for a holistic boat maintenance program, making it as valuable for owners as it is for buyers.""--Rhode Island Boating I would like to have had Surveying Fiberglass Sailboats . . . when I was in the market for a boat . . .

"Allergies: The Complete Guide to Diagnosis, Treatment, and Daily Management","Fifty million Americans suffer from allergies to certain foods, pollens, animal danders, dust mites and other less common allergens. Although the most common symptoms, from watery eyes to hives, are not life-threatening, there is a substantial cost in health care spending associated with these conditions. Americans spent about $18 billion each year on asthma care in 2009. And of the $19 billion spent each year on over-the-counter remedies, a substantial portion is spent on allergy medications. Now two specialists in allergy medicine reveal how to manage allergies safely and effectively, and live more comfortable, symptom-free lives. Allergies debunks the many myths about allergies and offers long-term help to both seasonal and chronic sufferers. This comprehensive and authoritative resource helps you make informed choices about everything from diagnostic tests to nasal antihistamines and corticosteroid sprays, from homeopathic remedies for poison ivy and insect bites to desensitizing therapies and emergency relief for severe allergic reactions and much more, including: • A detailed evaluation of the most common over-the-counter drugs • How to minimize allergens like mites, pollen and danders in your house. • Useful advice for life threatening allergies such as food and stinging insects. • Allergies and exercise • Allergies and pregnancy • Skin disorders from allergies • When allergy shots are unnecessary • Self-treatment versus traditional care • How to recognize and avoid allergy scam treatments • Allergies in children and the elderly • Plus a comprehensive guide to reliable information on the internet",['Bruce S.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Cliffs Notes),"A Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition of a counterculture classic, and the inspiration for the new Netflix original series Ratched, with a foreword by Chuck Palahniuk Boisterous, ribald, and ultimately shattering, Ken Kesey’s 1962 novel has left an indelible mark on the literature of our time. Now in a new deluxe edition with a foreword by Chuck Palahniuk and cover by Joe Sacco, here is the unforgettable story of a mental ward and its inhabitants, especially the tyrannical Big Nurse Ratched and Randle Patrick McMurphy, the brawling, fun-loving new inmate who resolves to oppose her. We see the struggle through the eyes of Chief Bromden, the seemingly mute half-Indian patient who witnesses and understands McMurphy’s heroic attempt to do battle with the powers that keep them all imprisoned. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

"The Politics of Dispossession: The Struggle for Palestinian Self-Determination, 1969-1994","Ever since the appearance of his groundbreaking The Question of Palestine, Edward Said has been America's most outspoken advocate for Palestinian self-determination. As these collected essays amply prove, he is also our most intelligent and bracingly heretical writer on affairs involving not only Palestinians but also the Arab and Muslim worlds and their tortuous relations with the West. In The Politics of Dispossession Said traces his people's struggle for statehood through twenty-five years of exile, from the PLO's bloody 1970 exile from Jordan through the debacle of the Gulf War and the ambiguous 1994 peace accord with Israel. As frank as he is about his personal involvement in that struggle, Said is equally unsparing in his demolition of Arab icons and American shibboleths. Stylish, impassioned, and informed by a magisterial knowledge of history and literature, The Politics of Dispossession is a masterly synthesis of scholarship and polemic that has the power to redefine the debate over the Middle East.",['Edward W.

How to Go to Hell,"Today’s churches do not always touch on the subject of hell. God does not want anyone to go to hell, but if they do not put Him first in their life and do His works, one might not end up where they think they are going. Pastor Seung Woo Byun explores specific and powerful promises of God that point to heaven and hell. Readers are guided through biblical End-Time prophecies, with special focus on the impending rapture of the true church—the bride of Christ. Many questions are answered by an overview of the Rapture, the Second Resurrection, the Antichrist, the role of the Jewish people, and what one must do to be prepared. This “must-read” book will not only reveal where you do not want to go (and why), but where you do want to go and how to get there through Christ Jesus.

"China's Provinces in Reform: Class, Community and Political Culture (Routledge in Asia S.)","China is a far larger and more diverse country than many people in the West realise. The provinces that make up the country are considerable social, economic and political systems in their own right. They are comparable in size and complexity to European states. China's Provinces in Reform is concerned with the impact of economic reform and social and politial change within the provinces at the immediate sub-central level of the People's Republic of China. One of the main aims of this book is to question over-generalizations about China's development in the reform era. However, the provincial analysis of social and political change in China also has the potential to reveal even more in a comparative perspective. This is the first volume of a series and covers Guangxi, Hainan, Liaoning, Shandong, Shanghai, Sichuan and Zhejiang.

Mr. Beddle had a lamb.(short story): An article from: Jack & Jill,"A serial murderer known only by a grotesquely apt nickname--Buffalo Bill--is stalking women. He has a purpose, but no one can fathom it, for the bodies are discovered in different states. Clarice Starling, a young trainee at the FBI Academy, is surprised to be summoned by Jack Crawford, chief of the Bureau's Behavioral Science section. Her assignment: to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter--Hannibal the Cannibal--who is kept under close watch in the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Dr. Lecter is a former psychiatrist with a grisly history, unusual tastes, and an intense curiosity about the darker corners of the mind. His intimate understanding of the killer and of Clarice herself form the core of Thomas Harris' The Silence of the Lambs--and ingenious, masterfully written book and an unforgettable classic of suspense fiction.",['Thomas Harris'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1d3XWXXxnEsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1d3XWXXxnEsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mr.+Beddle+had+a+lamb.(short+story):+An+article+from:+Jack&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Press,2009-12-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1d3XWXXxnEsC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],3135.0

Mathematical Logic for Computer Science,"Mathematical Logic for Computer Science is a mathematics textbook with theorems and proofs, but the choice of topics has been guided by the needs of students of computer science. The method of semantic tableaux provides an elegant way to teach logic that is both theoretically sound and easy to understand. The uniform use of tableaux-based techniques facilitates learning advanced logical systems based on what the student has learned from elementary systems. The logical systems presented are: propositional logic, first-order logic, resolution and its application to logic programming, Hoare logic for the verification of sequential programs, and linear temporal logic for the verification of concurrent programs.

"Marx""s Concept of Man","In publishing Marx's Concept of Man in 1961, Erich Fromm presented to the English-speaking world for the first time Karl Marx's then recently discovered Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts. Including the Manuscripts and many other philosophical writings by Marx as well as Fromm's own extended response, many of these writings have since become recognised as important works in their own right. Fromm stresses Marx's humanist philosophy and challenges both contemporary Western ignorance of Marx and Soviet corruptions of his work. Fromm's analysis of Marx's work and his dissemination of these neglected writings by Marx himself fundamentally altered the prevailing discourse about Marxism, revolutionising contemporary thought and providing a formative influence for the development of the New Left.","['Erich Fromm', 'Karl Marx']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z-5lmQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=z-5lmQEACAAJ&dq=Marx%22s+Concept+of+Man&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Academic,2013-12-19,http://books.google.com/books?id=z-5lmQEACAAJ&dq=Marx%22s+Concept+of+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],1.0

Experience of God,"Despite the recent ferocious public debate about belief, the concept most central to the discussion ""God"" frequently remains vaguely and obscurely described. Are those engaged in these arguments even talking about the same thing? In a wide-ranging response to this confusion, esteemed scholar David Bentley Hart pursues a clarification of how the word ""God"" functions in the world's great theistic faiths. Ranging broadly across Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Vedantic and Bhaktic Hinduism, Sikhism, and Buddhism, Hart explores how these great intellectual traditions treat humanity's knowledge of the divine mysteries. Constructing his argument around three principal metaphysical ""moments""--Being, consciousness, and bliss- the author demonstrates an essential continuity between our fundamental experience of reality and the ultimate reality to which that experience inevitably points.",['David Bentley Hart'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aD6MoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=aD6MoAEACAAJ&dq=Experience+of+God&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2014-08-31,http://books.google.com/books?id=aD6MoAEACAAJ&dq=Experience+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

A Good Stick,"Forced by federal regulations to retire at age 60, Jerry Sorlucco had served as an airline captain for nearly forty years and was probably the senior pilot on the planet. During that long career, he flew everything from DC3s to Boeing 767s. His memoir documents that experience professionally, personally and to some extent technically. Anyone with any curiosity about the life, work, gear and training of an airline pilot will find something engaging in this book. The story begins with an Italian kid from Brooklyn''s early love of flying and ends with his final flight from Frankfurt in 1997. Photographs of the aircraft Sorlucco flew, crewmembers, and his friends and family enhance the lively narrative. Given the sorry state of the airline industry, this story is especially timely. Sorlucco discusses some of the reasons for the industry''s collapse and offers some possible solutions. In fact, the entire narrative is framed in its historical context, so the reader will be constantly reminded of the wider world surrounding a personal journey. A Good Stick is a must read for the thousands of fellow pilots who shared an era with Jerry Sorlucco, for young pilots trying to keep afloat in a sea of airline red ink, and for anyone wondering what on Earth happened to America''s airline industry.

These new editions contain a new foreword from renowned theologian and author Alister McGrath, along with updated language to clarify less familiar illustrations from the originals and the inclusion of more contemporary language.

The Return of the Ragpicker,"Simon Potter’s new message of hope and courage for a troubled world Nearly twenty years ago in a Chicago parking lot, Og Mandino met a man who changed his life and who inspired millions of readers in the pages of Mandino’s classic bestseller The Greatest Miracle in the World. The man’s name was Simon Potter and he called himself a ragpicker—because he had devoted his life to rescuing people who had ended up on life’s refuse pile. But just as suddenly and mysteriously as Simon Potter entered Og Mandino’s life, so did he leave it—his work apparently done. Three years ago, however, Simon Potter walked back into Mandino's life. Ninety-five years old and going strong, the ragpicker knew his work was not yet finished; the world was still mired in frustration and despair, plagued by drugs, crime, broken families, and broken dreams. And so, he and Og Mandino vowed to deliver a precious new gift to humankind: a life guide to renewed strength, courage, wisdom, and faith for all.",['Og Mandino'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G43jWFxCvHwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=G43jWFxCvHwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Return+of+the+Ragpicker&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bantam,2010-12-29,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G43jWFxCvHwC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],2.0

Mind in Action,"Cognitive science – which draws on ideas from psychology, philosophy, linguistics and artificial intelligence (AI) – attempts to explain our mental life within a scientific framework. Its goal is, thus, to remove the last major obstacle to a unified scientific account of the natural world. In this title, originally published in 1991, Alan Garnham provides an invaluable introduction to this exciting new development in the study of mind. The Mind in Action focuses on the development of a systematic explanation of cognition, rather than on facts about the way we perceive things, remember them, talk about them, think about them, and interact with them. The author looks in detail at the nature of scientific explanations, the reasons for developing them, and the way they are assessed. He describes the work carried out by cognitive scientists and considers the questions that motivate it. He introduces the computational metaphor for the mind, and explains how flushing out the metaphor might lead to an integrated scientific account of mental phenomena. Designed primarily for people about to embark on courses in cognitive science and related disciplines, The Mind in Action captures the liveliness and excitement of debates about the mind. It is readily accessible to anyone with an interest in how the mind works, avoiding technical terms where possible and explaining them fully where they are necessary.",['Alan Garnham'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PkhnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PkhnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mind+in+Action&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2016-07-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PkhnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],

"From The Ground Up: The Story of ""Brother Van"", Montana Pioneer Minister, 1848-1919","This book, which was first published in 1961, is a biography of Rev. William Wesley Van Orsdel (1848-1919), known as “Brother Van”, a Methodist circuit rider in Montana who made a significant contribution to the spread of Methodism in Montana and the early development of the state’s public institutions. Throughout his career, Brother Van founded churches, universities, and hospitals; he converted and ministered to homesteaders, miners, and Native Americans; he worked with the elites and the poor, the famous and the forgotten in a career that spanned nearly 50 years. “To paint a word picture of the pioneer preacher and the pioneer territory which captures the real feeling which Brother Van had for Montana and which Montana had for Brother Van is almost impossible. But Bob Lind, a part of the Church which Brother Van helped to establish, has come closer than any writer to date. “Lind’s picture of Brother Van and his times is reliably accurate, though it was no easy task to detach fact from fiction in giving account of a man about whom stories grew like grass on the Montana prairie. He found in Brother Van’s life so much adventure and color that he only needed to tell the story as it was. “When you finish reading this book you will have met the best of the early frontier in the Rocky Mountain west. You will follow a man who made a pulpit for preaching the Good News out of the freighter’s or cowboy’s camp, the cabin or the ranch home, the Indian tepee, the barroom or the street corner.

MEN AT ARMS: A Novel of Discworld,"A Young Dwarf's Dream Corporal Carrot has been promoted! He's now in charge of the new recruits guarding Ankh-Morpork, Discworld's greatest city, from Barbarian Tribes, Miscellaneous Marauders, unlicensed Thieves, and such. It's a big job, particularly for an adopted dwarf. But an even bigger job awaits. An ancient document has just revealed that Ankh-Morpork, ruled for decades by Disorganized crime, has a secret sovereign! And his name is Carrott...

Forty Stories (Penguin Classics),"William H. Gass has written of Donald Barthelme that ""he has permanently enlarged our perception of the possibilities open to short fiction."" In Forty Stories, the companion volume to Sixty Stories, we encounter a dazzling array of subjects: Paul Klee, Goethe, Captain Blood, modern courtship, marriage and divorce, armadillos, and other unique Barthelmean flights of fancy. These pithy, brilliantly acerbic pieces tangle with the ludicrous, pose questions that remain unresolved, and challenge familiar bits of language heretofore unexamined. Forty Stories demonstrates Barthelme's unrivaled ability to surprise, to stimulate, and to explore. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",['Donald Barthelme'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=do5PEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=do5PEAAAQBAJ&dq=Forty+Stories+(Penguin+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2005-01-25,http://books.google.com/books?id=do5PEAAAQBAJ&dq=Forty+Stories+(Penguin+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],3.0

It offers general techniques for working with varying quantities of content and shows how designers can apply these techniques in their own work.

Beginning with the funeral of Edward VII, Tuchman traces each step that led to the inevitable clash. And inevitable it was, with all sides plotting their war for a generation.

The Forgotten War (Star Trek: The Next Generation),"The legendary Starfleet Captain Lucian Murat, a contemporary of Christopher Pike, disappeared in the course of a battle against the alien Tarn. Now, generations later, while Captain Jean-Luc Picard is conducting delicate diplomatic negotiations with the Tarn, the Enterprise discovers the descendants of Murat and his crew marooned on a desolate planet, still fighting a war that ended decades ago. The human castaways face destruction as the forgotten war builds to its catastrophic conclusion, but more is at stake than these precious lives alone. Planetside, and cut off from communication with the Enterprise, Commander Riker becomes entangled with the Federation refugees and their desperate struggle, and any action he takes could break the present ceasefire. Tarn observers face the same dilemma - but some feel the Tarn would welcome a renewal of hostilities. Unless Picard can find a solution, a lost hero's legacy may ignite a new era of interstellar war!",['William Forstchen'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S7VRAj5FLd4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=S7VRAj5FLd4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Forgotten+War+(Star+Trek:+The+Next+Generation)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2012-08-21,http://books.google.com/books?id=S7VRAj5FLd4C&dq=The+Forgotten+War+(Star+Trek:+The+Next+Generation)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

"Subjective, Intersubjective, Objective (Philosophical Essays of Donald Davidson)","Subjective, Intersubjective, Objective is the long-awaited third volume of philosophical writings by Donald Davidson, whose influence on philosophy since the 1960s has been deep and broad. His first two collections, published by OUP in the early 1980s, are recognized as contemporary classics. Now Davidson presents a selection of his work on knowledge, mind, and language from the 1980s and the 1990s. We all have knowledge of our own minds, knowledge of the contents of other minds, and knowledge of the shared environment.

"Into a Black Sun: Vietnam, 1964-65","This book is about books that recount the story of encountering another book. There are various versions of the story told and retold from the heyday of imperialism up to the present day (Homi Bhabha calls it the trope of ‘the discovery of the English book’); by considering each of these versions carefully, we may also give an alternative account of twentieth-century ‘English literature’ as the site of an intercultural discourse. This project is very much inspired by debate on postcolonial theory, namely, the debate between Said and Bhabha. Part I is devoted to the discussion of Conrad, especially of Heart of Darkness, and investigates how the novella has continually been reproduced to the extent that it represents ‘the English Book’ of colonial/postcolonial literatures. The chapter on Hugh Clifford (Ch.3) is virtually the first intensive critique of his novels, such as Saleh (1908), with a particular focus on their intertextual relations with Conrad’s texts. Part II examines how the story of the English Book is repeated and revised in the texts of the following authors: Joyce Cary, Isak Dinesen, V. S. Naipaul, Kaiko Takeshi, and Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o.",['Asako Nakai'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j0F0EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=j0F0EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA164&dq=Into+a+Black+Sun:+Vietnam,+1964-65&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",BRILL,2022-06-08,"http://books.google.com/books?id=j0F0EAAAQBAJ&dq=Into+a+Black+Sun:+Vietnam,+1964-65&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Literary Criticism'],

"Dr. Johnson's London: Coffee-Houses and Climbing Boys, Medicine, Toothpaste and Gin, Poverty and Press-Gangs, Freakshows and Female Education","The practical realities of everyday life are rarely described in history books. To remedy this, and to satisfy her own curiosity about the lives of our ancestors, Liza Picard immersed herself in contemporary sources - diaries and journals, almanacs and newspapers, government papers and reports, advice books and memoirs - to examine the substance of life in mid-18th century London. The fascinating result of her research, Dr. Johnson's London introduces the reader to every facet of that period: from houses and gardens to transport and traffic; from occupations and work to pleasure and amusements; from health and medicine to sex, food, and fashion. Stops along the way focus on education, etiquette, public executions as popular entertainment, and a melange of other historical curiosities. This book spans the period from 1740 to 1770--very much the city of Dr. Samuel Johnson, who published his great Dictionary in 1755. It starts when the gin craze was gaining ground and ends just before America ceased being a colony. In its enthralling review of an exhilarating era, Dr. Johnson's London brilliantly records the strangeness and individuality of the past--and continually reminds us of parallels with the present day.",['Liza Picard'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ywxOAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=ywxOAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dr.+Johnson%27s+London:+Coffee-Houses+and+Climbing+Boys,+Medicine,+Toothpaste+and+Gin,+Poverty+and+Press-Gangs,+Freakshows+and+Female+Education&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",St. Martin's Press,2014-01-28,"http://books.google.com/books?id=ywxOAgAAQBAJ&dq=Dr.+Johnson%27s+London:+Coffee-Houses+and+Climbing+Boys,+Medicine,+Toothpaste+and+Gin,+Poverty+and+Press-Gangs,+Freakshows+and+Female+Education&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],

The Bonds;: An American family,"This monumental history traces the rise of a resolute African American family (the author's own) from privation to the middle class. In doing so, it explodes the stereotypes that have shaped and distorted our thinking about African Americans--both in slavery and in freedom. Beginning with John Robert Bond, who emigrated from England to fight in the Union Army during the Civil War and married a recently freed slave, Alexander shows three generations of Bonds as they take chances and break new ground. From Victorian England to antebellum Virginia, from Herman Melville's New England to the Jim Crow South, from urban race riots to the battlefields of World War I, this fascinating chronicle sheds new light on eighty crucial years in our nation's troubled history. The Bond family's rise from slavery, their interaction with prominent figures such as W. E. B. DuBois and Booker T.

"Stars Beyond, The a Biographical Graveside Guide ( cemeteryS of Theda Bara, Humphrey Bogart, Bob Crane, Marion Davies, Sharon Tate, Rudolph Valentino , Peter Lorre, Marilyn Monroe, Bela Lugosi, Errol Flynn, Walt Disney, Zazu Pitts, Rosalind Russell ETC","Despite being a mediocre actress with less than classic beauty, Theda Bara was one of Hollywood’s leading performers in the early years of cinema. Her success was mostly due to Fox Studio’s publicity: they made her a screen vamp and used her to titillate the public. And Theda Bara, ambitious and nearing 30 when she made her first film, enthusiastically played the role. In real life, Theodosia Goodman bore little resemblance to the vampish Theda Bara character. But the studio-created persona, with the invented name, evil personality and fictional history, was a major star. Though her films were often trite, poorly acted, extravagant and crude, the public packed movie houses. But her film career ended once the public tired of the persona. Through contemporary newspaper accounts, film reviews, interviews and other sources, this is a comprehensive account of the life and times of one of Hollywood’s first female stars.",['Ronald Genini'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cmwfPXTQNSwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=cmwfPXTQNSwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Stars+Beyond,+The+a+Biographical+Graveside+Guide+(+cemeteryS+of+Theda+Bara,+Humphrey+Bogart,+Bob+Crane,+Marion+Davies,+Sharon+Tate,+Rudolph+Valentino+,+Peter+Lorre,+Marilyn+Monroe,+Bela+Lugosi,+Errol+Flynn,+Walt+Disney,+Zazu+Pitts,+Rosalind+Russell+ETC&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",McFarland,2013-02-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cmwfPXTQNSwC&source=gbs_api,['Performing Arts'],

Kieslowski (Rivages/cinema) (French Edition),"""Kieslowski's last films have indelibly marked the past decade. His cinema has renewed the representation of the human subject and emotion in film: space and luminous surface reveal the finest, most fragile impressions of states of mind and human consciousness. This study is the first to offer specific focus on Kies'lowski's last films, on his French-language cinema and its place within the broader context of French film-making. Engaging with Deleuze's discussions of the time-image, and recent work in trauma theory, Emma Wilson offers radical insights into the innovation in Kies'lowski's explorations of memory, temporality, loss and desire. A charged defence of Kies'lowski's work, Memory and Survival offers new readings of this cinema of blind chance and fleeting beauty.""",['Emma Wilson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_iNBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_iNBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT177&dq=Kieslowski+(Rivages/cinema)+(French+Edition)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2017-12-02,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_iNBDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

How to Dump Your Wife: Practical Advice for the Good Man Trapped in A Bad Marriage,"Read the controversial book Howard Stern considers required reading for any man (or woman) even considering divorce! This third edition is newly revised and updated. Unlike other divorce books, this one preaches no stay-together sermons and offers no sugarcoated guidance. When author Lee Covington appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show the audience was stunned to learn that this book was actually written by a woman. How to Dump Your Wife is for those who have accepted that sometimes a marriage is simply beyond saving—regardless of whether a desperate or vengeful wife can accept that fact. Irreverent, funny, and brutally honest, Lee Covington teaches men to survive divorce despite a legal system in which the cards are heavily stacked against them. Her practical advice on withstanding the emotional and financial ravages of divorce focuses on how to survive three types of wives: (1) the doting, clingy sweetheart who wants to stay married at all costs; (2) the shrill, abusive, spiteful, soul-sucking harpy; and (3) the self-absorbed career woman with powerful friends and her own agenda.

The Logico-algebraic approach to quantum mechanics (The University of Western Ontario series in philosophy of science ; v. 5),"The twentieth century has witnessed a striking transformation in the understanding of the theories of mathematical physics. There has emerged clearly the idea that physical theories are significantly characterized by their abstract mathematical structure. This is in opposition to the tradi tional opinion that one should look to the specific applications of a theory in orrter to understand it. One might with reason now espouse the view that to understand the deeper character of a theory one must know its abstract structure and understand the significance of that structure, while to understand how a theory might be modified in light of its experimental inadequacies one must be intimately acquainted with how it is applied. Quantum theory itself has gone through a development this century which illustrates strikingly the shifting perspective. From a collection of intuitive physical manoeuvers under Bohr, through a formative stage in which the mathematical framework was bifurcated (between Schrodinger and Heisenberg) to an elegant culmination in von Neumann's Hilbert space formulation, the elementary theory moved, flanked even at this later stage by the ill-understood formalisms for the relativistic version and for the field-theoretic alternative; after that we have a gradual, but constant, elaboration of all these quantal theories as abstract mathematical structures (their point of departure being von Neumann's formalism) until at the present time theoretical work is heavily preoccupied with the manipulation of purely abstract structures.",['C.A.

What's the Girl Worth?,"Written by Rachael Denhollander, recipient of Sports Illustrated’s Inspiration of the Year Award and one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People (2018). “Who is going to tell these little girls that what was done to them matters? That they are seen and valued, that they are not alone and they are not unprotected?” Rachael Denhollander’s voice was heard around the world when she spoke out to end the most shocking USA gymnastics scandal in history. The first victim to publicly accuse Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor who sexually abused hundreds of young athletes, Rachael now reveals her full story for the first time. How did Nassar get away with it for so long? How did Rachael and the other survivors finally stop him and bring him to justice? And how can we protect the vulnerable in our own families, churches, and communities? What Is a Girl Worth? is the inspiring true story of Rachael’s journey from an idealistic young gymnast to a strong and determined woman who found the courage to raise her voice against evil, even when she thought the world might not listen. In this crucial cultural moment of #MeToo and #ChurchToo, this deeply personal and compelling narrative shines a spotlight on the physical and emotional impact of abuse, why so many survivors are reluctant to speak out, and what it means to be believed.",['Rachael Denhollander'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BV-MDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=BV-MDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=What%27s+the+Girl+Worth%3F&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.",2019-09-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BV-MDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],6.0

Mark My Words : Letters Of A Businessman To His Son,"This book demonstrates that during Japan’s early modern Edo period (1603–1868) an ethical code existed among the merchant class comparable to that of the well-known Bushido. There is compelling evidence that contemporary merchants, who were widely and openly despised as immoral by the samurai, in fact acted in highly ethical ways in accordance with a well-articulated moral code. Japanese society was strictly stratified into four distinct and formally recognized classes: warrior, farmer, craftsman and merchant. From the warriors’ perspective, the merchants, at the base of the social order, had no virtue, and existed only to skim profits as middlemen between producers and consumers. But were these accusations correct? Were the merchants really unethical beings who engaged in unfair business practices? There is ample evidence that negates the ubiquitous slanders of the warrior class and suggests that merchants – no less than the warriors – possessed and acted in accordance with a well-developed ethical code, a spirit that may be called shonindo or “The Way of the Merchant.” This book examines whether a comparison of shonindo, depicting the ethical point of view of the merchant class, and Bushido, embodying that of the warrior class, reveals that shonindo may have in fact surpassed Bushido in some aspects. Comparing contemporarily published historical documents concerning both shonindo and Bushido, as well as Inazo Nitobe’s classic work Bushido: The Soul of Japan, published in 1900, the author examines how Bushido surpassed shonindo in that warriors were willing to die for their strict ethical code. Shonindo, however, may have surpassed Bushido in that merchants were liberal, willing to expand and extend application of their ethical beliefs into all aspects of everyday life for the overall benefit of society. This ethical code is compared with that of the conservative Bushido, which demonstrably proved not up to the task for the modernization and improved well-being of Japan. Ichiro Horide is professor emeritus of Reitaku University. Edward Yagi (Reitaku University) and Stanley J. Ziobro II (Trident Technical College) collaborated in the translation of the original Japanese manuscript into English.",['Ichiro Horide'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ccWgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ccWgDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA210&dq=Mark+My+Words+:+Letters+Of+A+Businessman+To+His+Son&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Springer,2019-07-04,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ccWgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],

It considers goodness and beauty, human existents as individual, relational units (e.g., the family), agents and goals, chance and evil. It is in contrast with Sartrean existentialism, process philosophy, linguistic analysis, phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstructionism.","['Leo Sweeney', 'William J. Carroll', 'John J.

The Millstone,"The story of an upper-middle-class unwed mother in 1960s London, from a novelist who is “often as meticulous as Jane Austen and as deadly as Evelyn Waugh” (Los Angeles Times). In a newly swinging London, Rosamund Stacey indulges in a premarital sexual encounter—and soon thereafter finds herself pregnant. Despite her fierce independence and academic brilliance, Rosamund is in fact naïve and unworldly, and the choices before her are terrifying. But in the perfection and helplessness of her baby she finds an unconditional love she has never known before—and as she navigates a situation still considered scandalous in her circles, she may discover that motherhood and independence need not be mutually exclusive. From “one of Britain’s most dazzling writers,” the award-winning author of The Dark Flood Rises, The Millstone captures both a moment in history when women’s lives were changing dramatically and the timeless truths of the female experience (The New York Times Book Review).",['Margaret Drabble'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LuG2v690YIYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LuG2v690YIYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Millstone&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,HMH,1998-10-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LuG2v690YIYC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],14.0

Data screening and data entry into statistical programs is explained and accompanied by illustrations of statistical analyses and graphs. Additional features of the Fourth Edition include: A new chapter on data collection that outlines the initial steps in planning biomedical and public health studies A new chapter on nonparametric statistics that includes a discussion and application of the Sign test, the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and its relationship to the Mann-Whitney U test An updated introduction to survival analysis that includes the Kaplan Meier method for graphing the survival function and a brief introduction to tests for comparing survival functions Incorporation of modern statistical software, such as SAS, Stata, SPSS, and Minitab into the presented discussion of data analysis Updated references at the end of each chapter Basic Statistics, Fourth Edition is an ideal book for courses on biostatistics, medicine, and public health at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels.

Apostolic Tradition Hermeneia (Hermeneia: A Critical & Historical Commentary on the Bible),"The anonymous early church order that became known as the Apostolic Tradition and conventionally attributed to Hippolytus of Rome has generated enormous scholarly discussion since its discovery in the nineteenth century. Surprisingly, however, there has never before been a comprehensive commentary on it such as there is for other patristic works. We have here attempted to remedy this defect, and at the same time we have offered the first full synoptic presentation in English of the various witnesses to its text. We have also taken the opportunity to develop our argument that it is neither the work of Hippolytus nor of any other individual. Instead, we believe that it is a composite document made up of a number of layers and strands of diverse provenance and compiled over a period of time, and therefore not representing the practice of any one Christian community. — from the Preface This Hermeneia volume provides an important contribution to New Testament research as well as the study of the patristic era.","['Paul F.

"Ducking Spears, Dancing Madly","A penetrating look at church leadership through the stories of Saul, David, and other central Old Testament figures. The Bible portrays leaders not as heroes placed on a pedestal, but rather as flawed and fallen human beings who nonetheless work with the people around them and with the situation at hand to move toward accomplishing the will of God. Lewis Parks and Bruce Birch maintain that a clear, open-eyed understanding of biblical stories on the exercise of leadership is the only way to prepare for leadership in the church. In order to provide that understanding, they engage in a dialogue with the books of 1 and 2 Samuel, texts that portray the people of Israel in frequent social and political transition, and hence in need of effective leadership.","['Lewis Parks', 'Bruce C.

Mr. Lincoln's army,"A vivid account of the early battles, first in the Pulitzer Prize-winning trilogy: “One of America’s foremost Civil War authorities” (Kirkus Reviews). The first book in Bruce Catton’s Pulitzer Prize–winning Army of the Potomac Trilogy, Mr. Lincoln’s Army is a riveting history of the early years of the Civil War, when a fledgling Union Army took its stumbling first steps under the command of the controversial general George McClellan. Following the secession of the Southern states, a beleaguered President Abraham Lincoln entrusted the dashing, charismatic McClellan with the creation of the Union’s Army of the Potomac and the responsibility of leading it to a swift and decisive victory against Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. Although a brilliant tactician who was beloved by his troops and embraced by the hero-hungry North, McClellan’s ego and ambition ultimately put him at loggerheads with his commander in chief—a man McClellan considered unworthy of the presidency. McClellan’s weaknesses were exposed during the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in American military history, which ended in a stalemate even though the Confederate troops were greatly outnumbered. After Antietam, Lincoln ordered McClellan’s removal from command, and the Union entered the war’s next chapter having suffered thousands of casualties and with great uncertainty ahead. America’s premier chronicler of the nation’s brutal internecine conflict, Bruce Catton is renowned for his unparalleled ability to bring a detailed and vivid immediacy to Civil War battlefields and military strategy sessions. With tremendous depth and insight, he presents legendary commanders and common soldiers in all their complex and heartbreaking humanity.",['Bruce Catton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PVuMCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PVuMCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mr.+Lincoln%27s+army&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2015-11-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PVuMCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],7.0

"Inorganic Materials Chemistry Desk Reference, Second Edition","The updated second edition of the popular Inorganic Materials Chemistry Desk Reference remains a valuable resource in the preparation of solid-state inorganic materials by chemical processing techniques. It also expands upon new chemical precursors available to materials scientists, the applications of those materials, and existing or emerging topics where materials chemistry plays an important role, such as in microelectronics, surface science, and nanotechnology. This edition places additional emphasis on additives, characterization techniques and structure-property relationships, and materials classifications based on type and applications, including electronics, biomaterials, thin films, and coatings. Other new topics include combinatorial chemistry, nanostructures and technology, surface materials chemistry, biomimetic processing, and novel forms of carbon. The authors discuss the role of materials chemistry in micro- and nano-fabrication, self-assembly, scanning probe microscopy, and carbon fullerenes. The new edition adds forty black and white figures, over 200 new definitions, and 50% more new chemical precursors and their properties. With a new and improved reference format, Inorganic Materials Chemistry Desk Reference continues to be a constructive resource to specialists conducting research in materials chemistry.","['D.

Predator Group,"Many animals regulate their population density by patterns of behavior that would be easy to explain if the forces of natural selection acted to optimize group properties. But Darwinian selection acts on individuals, not groups, and most simple theories have shown group selection to be too slow ever to oppose individual selection successfully. In this book Michael Gilpin presents a model, based on predator-prey dynamics, wherein nonlinear effects are important, so that small advantages to the selfish individual are nonlinearly amplified into disaster for his group. The result is that group selection can be rapid and powerful. Of course many instances of apparent group selection can be explained by kin selection; in other cases, close examination reveals that seemingly altruistic behavior directly benefits the individual genotype as well as the group. The value of the monograph is that it provides a robust model in which group selection, pure and unadulterated, can be seen to work.",['Michael E.

Soundscape,"The soundscape--a term coined by the author--is our sonic environment, the ever-present array of noises with which we all live. Beginning with the primordial sounds of nature, we have experienced an ever-increasing complexity of our sonic surroundings. As civilization develops, new noises rise up around us: from the creaking wheel, the clang of the blacksmith’s hammer, and the distant chugging of steam trains to the “sound imperialism” of airports, city streets, and factories. The author contends that we now suffer from an overabundance of acoustic information and a proportionate diminishing of our ability to hear the nuances and subtleties of sound. Our task, he maintains, is to listen, analyze, and make distinctions. As a society we have become more aware of the toxic wastes that can enter our bodies through the air we breathe and the water we drink. In fact, the pollution of our sonic environment is no less real. Schafer emphasizes the importance of discerning the sounds that enrich and feed us and using them to create healthier environments. To this end, he explains how to classify sounds, appreciating their beauty or ugliness, and provides exercises and “soundwalks” to help us become more discriminating and sensitive to the sounds around us. This book is a pioneering exploration of our acoustic environment, past and present, and an attempt to imagine what it might become in the future.",['R.

He does so, not with abstract opinions but with apt and colourful examples taken from the past and the present: Sam Steele’s gold rush censorship of the Turkish Whirlwind Danseuse; Ontario’s grudging acceptance of beer in three Toronto ballparks; New York’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade; Lorne Greene’s rueful return to Toronto; William Van Horne’s tirade against winter carnivals; the role of Kentucky in the War of 1812; W.A.C.

Panzer divisions spearheaded the German assault with Stuka dive-bombers prowling ahead spreading terror and mayhem.

A Catechism of the Liberal Catholic Church,"This is the fourth edition of Archbishop Wynn Wagner's Liberal Catholic Catechism. The first edition was published when he was a rookie priest with Holy Water behind the ears. Now comes an update from Wynn as a lah-dee-dah my-incense-don't even-stink archbishop. And yet it still works as an easy-to-read introduction to a little known branch of the church catholic. The Liberal Catholic Church was started in England in the early part of the 20th century. It welcomes everyone, especially sinners, and is one of the most tolerant and accepting denominations you can imagine. Straight/gay, young/old, pro-life/pro-choice. Some believe in reincarnation and ascended masters. Others come for the mysticism and healing liturgies, while many attend because of the stately beauty of the Liberal Catholic liturgy. The amazing thing is that the Liberal Rite works for all of them. The archbishop introduces you to the major concepts of the Rite, from the simple to the esoteric. The Liberal Catholic Church is one of the most dynamic groups of independent Catholics in history.

Pioneers of Islamic Revival: Second Edition,"Ali Shariati (1933–77) has been called by many the 'ideologue of the Iranian Revolution'. An inspiration to many of the revolutionary generation, Shariati's combination of Islamic political thought and Left-leaning ideology continues to influence both in Iran and across the wider Muslim world. In this book, Siavash Saffari examines Shariati's long-standing legacy, and how new readings of his works by contemporary 'neo-Shariatis' have contributed to a deconstruction of the false binaries of Islam/modernity, Islam/West, and East/West. Saffari argues that through their critique of Eurocentric metanarratives on the one hand, and the essentialist conceptions of Islam on the other, Shariati and neo-Shariatis have carved out a new space in Islamic thought beyond the traps of Orientalism and Occidentalism. This unique perspective will hold great appeal to researchers of the politics and intellectual thought of post-revolutionary Iran and the greater Middle East.",['Siavash Saffari'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9IQ7DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9IQ7DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA190&dq=Pioneers+of+Islamic+Revival:+Second+Edition&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,2017-02-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9IQ7DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],

Managing New Industry Creation: Global Knowledge Formation and Entrepreneurship in High Technology,"This book concerns industry creation as knowledge creation. The authors argue that a new class of global, knowledge-driven manufacturing industries has emerged in which learning, continuity, and speed define competition. In these new industries, access to knowledge creation processes matters more than ownership of physical assets. Location matters only insofar as it confers learning advantages and market access. Companies need strategies that can mobilize their organizations' country-specific strengths and freely leverage them in open, global learning partnerships with allies, suppliers, and customers. Managing New Industry Creation distills principles that managers can use to seize leadership for their companies as these new industries emerge. The authors draw their insights from firsthand discussions with over 160 managers and scientists who helped found the high-information-content flat panel display (FPD) industry. In the early 1990s, large-format FPDs exploded into public knowledge as a critical enabling technology for notebook computers. In the future, FPDs will increasingly function as the face by which users interact with technology products. The book recounts the business decisions that propelled the industry from humble beginnings to empower a globally mobile workforce and eventually build wall-hanging, high definition televisions that every household can afford. The FPD industry was the first new manufacturing industry to fully emerge in a global economy defined more by trade in knowledge than in physical products. Although FPDs were commercialized in Japan, the joint efforts of an international community of companies made high-volume production of large displays viable. Companies from outside of Japan—including IBM, Applied Materials, and Corning—achieved key positions by challenging U.S.-centered preconceptions of innovation, new business creation, and management process, giving unprecedented global authority and responsibility to their Japanese affiliates. Their success established new rules for competing in the knowledge-driven, global manufacturing industries of the future, first described here for managers, R&D scientists, academics, and students of corporate strategy.","['Thomas Murtha', 'Stefanie Lenway', 'Jeffrey Hart']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=glq_bMdXpmcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=glq_bMdXpmcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Managing+New+Industry+Creation:+Global+Knowledge+Formation+and+Entrepreneurship+in+High+Technology&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Stanford University Press,2002-11-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=glq_bMdXpmcC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],

Teaching Your Children About God: A Modern Jewish Approach,"Many parents find it easier to talk to their children about sex and other intimate matters than to answer questions about God, prayer, good, and evil. In fact, parents may feel they don't know the answers to such questions for themselves, much less for their young children. In Teaching Your Children About God, Rabbi David Wolpe shows Jewish parents how to openly explore the idea of God with their children. Through poignant anecdotes and practical exercises, Wolpe teaches how parents can guide children in the practice of prayer and create an atmosphere in which children feel comfortable questioning and wondering about God, life, and death. Wolpe also offers invaluable insights into children's spiritual needs, reveals the powerful effect faith can have on a child's self-esteem, and enables parents to understand their children's fears, dreams, and hopes. Perhaps most important, this wise and potentially life-changing book shows parents who may feel something missing In their own spiritual lives that it is possible to nourish their own souls even as they nurture their children's.",['David J.

Language & the pursuit of truth,"The official book on the Rust programming language, written by the Rust development team at the Mozilla Foundation, fully updated for Rust 2018. The Rust Programming Language is the official book on Rust: an open source systems programming language that helps you write faster, more reliable software. Rust offers control over low-level details (such as memory usage) in combination with high-level ergonomics, eliminating the hassle traditionally associated with low-level languages. The authors of The Rust Programming Language, members of the Rust Core Team, share their knowledge and experience to show you how to take full advantage of Rust's features--from installation to creating robust and scalable programs. You'll begin with basics like creating functions, choosing data types, and binding variables and then move on to more advanced concepts, such as: • Ownership and borrowing, lifetimes, and traits • Using Rust's memory safety guarantees to build fast, safe programs • Testing, error handling, and effective refactoring • Generics, smart pointers, multithreading, trait objects, and advanced pattern matching • Using Cargo, Rust's built-in package manager, to build, test, and document your code and manage dependencies • How best to use Rust's advanced compiler with compiler-led programming techniques You'll find plenty of code examples throughout the book, as well as three chapters dedicated to building complete projects to test your learning: a number guessing game, a Rust implementation of a command line tool, and a multithreaded server.

Second Chance: Biblical Principles of Divorce and Remarriage (Biblical Blueprints),"For the last several decades, at the far fringes of American evangelical Christianity has stood an intellectual movement known as Christian Reconstruction. The proponents of this movement embrace a radical position: that all of life should be brought under the authority of biblical law as it is contained in both the Old and New Testaments. They challenge the legitimacy of democracy, argue that slavery is biblically justifiable, and support the death penalty for all manner of ""crimes"" described in the Bible including homosexuality, adultery, and Sabbath-breaking. But, as Julie Ingersoll shows in this fascinating new book, this ""Biblical Worldview"" shapes their views not only on political issues, but on everything from private property and economic policy to history and literature. Holding that the Bible provides a coherent, internally consistent, and all-encompassing worldview, they seek to remake the entirety of society--church, state, family, economy--along biblical lines. Tracing the movement from its mid-twentieth-century origins in the writings of theologian and philosopher R.J. Rushdoony to its present-day sites of influence, including the Christian Home School movement, advocacy for the teaching of creationism, and the development and rise of the Tea Party, Ingersoll illustrates how Reconstructionists have broadly and subtly shaped conservative American Protestantism over the course of the late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries. Drawing on interviews with Reconstructionists themselves as well as extensive research in Reconstructionist publications, Building God's Kingdom offers the most complete and balanced portrait to date of this enigmatic segment of the Christian Right.",['Julie J.

Managers looking to take advantage of new opportunities will turn to business rules to implement change. IT has already learned the benefits of separating data by processing and managing data as an independent component of systems. A rules-extended development approach does exactly the same thing for business rules: by reducing the amount of code that needs to be written, it shortens the time necessary to implement change.

Guerilla days in Ireland,"First published in 1949, 'Guerilla Days in Ireland' is an extraordinary story of the Irish War of Independence and the fight between two unequal forces, which ended in the withdrawal of the British from twenty-six counties. Seven weeks before the Truce of July 1921, the British presence in County Cork consisted of a total of over 12,500 men. Against these British forces stood the Irish Republican Army whose flying columns never exceeded 310 riflemen in the whole of the county. These flying columns were small groups of dedicated Volunteers, severely commanded and disciplined. Constantly on the move, their paramount objective was merely to exist, to strike when conditions were favourable and to avoid disaster at all costs. In 'Guerilla Days in Ireland' Tom Barry describes the setting up of the West Cork flying column, its training and the plan of campaign, which he implemented.

Doohickey : A Novel,"Nick Fashon is having a bad day. He's just found out his estranged grandfather has died mysteriously in the Arizona desert. Then he meets his potential father-in-law, who turns out to be an ex-cop with a screw loose and a penchant for bean dip. To top it off, he returns home to find his successful clothing shop has just burned to the ground and taken his upstairs apartment with it. Love & Fashion was Nick Fashon and Vince Love's thriving clothing store until it went up in flames -- the work of an arsonist, police say. Suddenly Nick is homeless and disillusioned, and both the insurance investigators and the police want a word with him. Where can he turn for help? He's wearing out his welcome with his archaeologist girlfriend, Gretchen, who's developing her own suspicions about him. His business partner and best friend, Vince, isn't much help either, as Nick discovers more and more disturbing clues that point to Vince as the one who set the blaze. Things begin to look up when Nick finds out his eccentric late grandfather has left him an unusual inheritance: a thriving pet-coffin business and a barn full of peculiar inventions, including one particularly interesting doohickey called the HandyMate. The HandyMate is the ultimate kitchen gadget -- a simple tool that can cut, core, chop, slice, and potentially transform the domestic world. Full of entrepreneurial zeal, Nick is determined to see one in every kitchen drawer in America. But Nick isn't the only one planning to strike it rich with the HandyMate. Yola Fuentes, Nick's grandfather's irresistibly sexy business partner, is so determined to get the HandyMate that she makes Nick an offer he can't refuse.

The Book of Inside Information,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A riveting, true-life legal thriller about the government’s pursuit of billionaire hedge fund manager Steven Cohen and his employees at SAC Capital—a revelatory look at the power and wealth of Wall Street ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR—The New York Times and The Economist • “An essential exposé of our times—a work that reveals the deep rot in our financial system . . . Everyone should read this book.”—David Grann, author of Killers of the Flower Moon Steven A. Cohen changed Wall Street. He and his fellow pioneers of the hedge fund industry didn’t lay railroads, build factories, or invent new technologies. Rather, they made their billions through financial speculation, by placing bets in the market that turned out to be right more often than not. Cohen was revered as one of the greatest traders who ever lived. But that image was shattered when his fund, SAC Capital, became the target of a seven-year government investigation. Prosecutors labeled SAC a “magnet for market cheaters” whose culture encouraged the relentless pursuit of “edge”—and even “black edge,” which is inside information—and the firm was ultimately indicted and pleaded guilty to charges related to a vast insider trading scheme. Cohen, himself, however, was never charged. Black Edge raises urgent and troubling questions about those who sit at the pinnacle of high finance and how they have reshaped the economy.

Die Broke : A Radical 4-Part Personal Finance Plan to Restore Your Confidence Increase Your Net Worth and Afford the Lifestyle of Your Dreams (Cassette),"From America's most trusted financial advisor comes a comprehensive guide to a new and utterly sane financial choice. In Die Broke, you'll learn that life is a game where the loser gives his money to Uncle Sam at the end. There are four steps to the process: Quit Today No, don't tell your boss to shove it...at least not out loud. But in your head accept that from this day on you're a free agent whose number one workplace priority is your personal bottom line. Pay Cash You should be as conscious of spending as you are of saving. Credit should be a rarely used tool for those few times (buying homes and cars) when paying cash is impossible. Don't Retire Your work life should be a journey up and down hills, rather than a climb up a sheer cliff that ends with a jump into the abyss. Die Broke It sounds terrifying, the one intolerable outcome to your financial life. And yet, in truth, dying broke might be your best option for a life without fear: fear of failure and privation now, fear of impoverishment in the long run.","['Stephen Pollan', 'Mark Levine']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H5-UOT4K4QgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=H5-UOT4K4QgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Die+Broke+:+A+Radical+4-Part+Personal+Finance+Plan+to+Restore+Your+Confidence+Increase+Your+Net+Worth+and+Afford+the+Lifestyle+of+Your+Dreams+(Cassette)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2009-03-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H5-UOT4K4QgC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],7.0

Wanderlust,"A passionate, thought provoking exploration of walking as a political and cultural activity, from the author of the memoir Recollections of My Nonexistence Drawing together many histories--of anatomical evolution and city design, of treadmills and labyrinths, of walking clubs and sexual mores--Rebecca Solnit creates a fascinating portrait of the range of possibilities presented by walking. Arguing that the history of walking includes walking for pleasure as well as for political, aesthetic, and social meaning, Solnit focuses on the walkers whose everyday and extreme acts have shaped our culture, from philosophers to poets to mountaineers. She profiles some of the most significant walkers in history and fiction--from Wordsworth to Gary Snyder, from Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet to Andre Breton's Nadja--finding a profound relationship between walking and thinking and walking and culture. Solnit argues for the necessity of preserving the time and space in which to walk in our ever more car-dependent and accelerated world.",['Rebecca Solnit'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g1jIkcOH18gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=g1jIkcOH18gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Wanderlust&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2001-06-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=g1jIkcOH18gC&dq=Wanderlust&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],14.0

Surely new faces and a change of pace could help her gather her thoughts.

Household demand for money in Poland: Theory and evidence (IMF working paper),"This paper examines the household demand for narrow money in Poland during the 1980s. At that time, there were shortages, but informal trade in both goods and foreign exchange was common, and holdings of foreign currency were substantial. Household money demand in this environment is first examined at the theoretical level: a representative household`s holding of domestic and foreign money is analyzed in a cash-in-advance model in which domestic currency is needed to purchase goods in the official shops while either domestic or foreign currency can be used in the black market. This model gives rise to a formulation of money demand which is then estimated using household-level data from 1979 to 1988.",['Timothy Lane'],,http://books.google.com/books?id=SqvnzgEACAAJ&dq=Household+demand+for+money+in+Poland:+Theory+and+evidence+(IMF+working+paper)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2006,http://books.google.com/books?id=SqvnzgEACAAJ&dq=Household+demand+for+money+in+Poland:+Theory+and+evidence+(IMF+working+paper)&hl=&source=gbs_api,,

The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism,"Ever since the shocking revelations of the fascist ties of Martin Heidegger and Paul de Man, postmodernism has been haunted by the specter of a compromised past. In this intellectual genealogy of the postmodern spirit, Richard Wolin shows that postmodernism’s infatuation with fascism has been extensive and widespread. He questions postmodernism’s claim to have inherited the mantle of the Left, suggesting instead that it has long been enamored with the opposite end of the political spectrum. Wolin reveals how, during in the 1930s, C. G. Jung, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Georges Bataille, and Maurice Blanchot were seduced by fascism's promise of political regeneration and how this misapprehension affected the intellectual core of their work. The result is a compelling and unsettling reinterpretation of the history of modern thought. In a new preface, Wolin revisits this illiberal intellectual lineage in light of the contemporary resurgence of political authoritarianism.",['Richard Wolin'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TX5_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=TX5_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Seduction+of+Unreason:+The+Intellectual+Romance+with+Fascism+from+Nietzsche+to+Postmodernism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Princeton University Press,2019-04-30,http://books.google.com/books?id=TX5_DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Seduction+of+Unreason:+The+Intellectual+Romance+with+Fascism+from+Nietzsche+to+Postmodernism&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],

"Continental Philosophy since 1750: The Rise and Fall of the Self (A History of Western Philosophy, Vol. 7)","The explosion of creative and speculative philosophy that emerged in Europe in the second half of the eighteenth century is a thrilling intellectual adventure story, as well as an essential chapter in the history of philosophy. The main theme of this story is the rise and fall of the Self. The Self in question is no ordinary self - no individual personality nor even one of the many heroic or mock-heroic personalities of the early nineteenth century. The Self is the Transcendental Self, whose nature and ambitions are unprecedently arrogant, cosmic and often obscure. In modest terms, this universal self is human nature. In less modest terms, the Transcendental Self is nothing less than God. This thesis is what Solomon terms the Transcendental Pretence.

The Rise of Southern Republicans,"The transformation of Southern politics over the past fifty years has been one of the most significant developments in American political life. The emergence of formidable Republican strength in the previously solid Democratic South has generated a novel and highly competitive national battle for control of Congress. Tracing the slow and difficult rise of Republicans in the South over five decades, Earl and Merle Black tell the remarkable story of political upheaval. The Rise of Southern Republicans provides a compelling account of growing competitiveness in Southern party politics and elections. Through extraordinary research and analysis, the authors track Southern voters' shifting economic, cultural, and religious loyalties, black/white conflicts and interests during and after federal civil rights intervention, and the struggles and adaptations of congressional candidates and officials. A newly competitive South, the authors argue, means a newly competitive and revitalized America. The story of how the South became a two-party region is ultimately the story of two-party politics in America at the end of the twentieth century. Earl and Merle Black have written a bible for anyone who wants to understand regional and national congressional politics over the past half-century. Because the South is now at the epicenter of Republican and Democratic strategies to control Congress, The Rise of Southern Republicans is essential to understanding the dynamics of current American politics. Table of Contents: 1. The Southern Transformation 2. Confronting the Democratic Juggernaut 3. The Promising Peripheral South 4. The Impenetrable Deep South 5. The Democratic Smother 6.

The Republican Surge 12. Competitive South, Competitive America Notes Index Reviews of this book: These two leading scholars of Southern politics present a rigorous investigation of how voting in the peripheral South (Florida, Arkansas, Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee) and the Deep South (Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina) was realigned since Ronald Reagan was first elected president in 1980. --Karl Helicher, Library Journal With publication of their latest book, The Rise of Southern Republicans the Blacks, both 60, have produced a trilogy that traces an almost geologic-style evolution in the South's political landscape. They've analyzed the whys and what-fors of a region, that in the past 50 years, has gone from impenetrably Democratic to competitively Republican. Their overarching conclusion: the two-party warfare that defines the South defines the nation...The Blacks' work--a mix of political wonkery and historical perspective, cut with the deliciously illuminating anecdote--is read by academics in various disciplines and political junkies of all stripes. The books are valued for their coolly dissecting insights...Because their writing swells beyond the data-crunching lab work of most political scientists--though new readers beware: The books are littered with scary-looking charts and graphs--it travels beyond academia. Party strategists are steeped in the work. ""The Blacks wrote the book on how academic political science can illuminate practical politics,"" says Republican pollster Whit Ayers. --Drew Jubera, Atlanta Journal-Constitution The South's political identity has been transformed in the last half-century from a region of Democratic hegemony to a region of Republican majority. Earl and Merle Black...sedulously examine this remarkable change...This is a work of serious scholarship that lacks any hint of a partisan purpose. Committed readers will increase their understanding of both Southern and national politics. The Blacks' effort may well be the definitive statement on Southern politics over the 20th century. --Publishers Weekly Not since 1872, Earl Black and Merle Black point out in their third book on Southern politics, had the Republicans constructed majorities from both the North and the South in both houses, and it was the national character of their victory that made the 1994 election such a landmark...In The Rise of Southern Republicans, the Black brothers chronicle the party's history from the 1930s to the present, election by election. They illuminate the economic, racial and political dynamics that gradually moved the South toward the Republican Party, while also warning that the Republicans do not by any means own the region in the way the Democrats once did. --Kevin Sack, New York Times Book Review In The Rise of Southern Republicans brothers Earl and Merle Black explain the partisan realignment that has brought the South into the national political mainstream. The Blacks...focus most of their attention on the congressional arena, where voting patterns reflect long-term partisan loyalty more closely than at the presidential level...[T]he story the authors of The Rise of Southern Republicans tell is a fascinating one, with implications for American politics that are both profound and uncertain. --David Lowe, Weekly Standard The rise of southern Republicans is one of the most consequential stories in modern American politics. For political reporters of a certain generation...the Democratic dominance of Southern congressional politics is barely understood. The Black brothers make it all very clear. --Major Garrett, Washington Monthly This superb analysis of Southern politics by Earl Black...and his brother Merle Black...not only tracks the recent rise of Republicans in the South but explains why party realignment along ideological lines was so long in coming to that region...The Rise of Southern Republicans is already being rightly hailed as a political science classic. Its strength is the thorough and systematic manner in which it examines the changing ways a wide variety of factors have affected Southern voting patterns over the past four decades. The data and the rigor of the analysis are truly impressive. --James D. Fairbanks, Houston Chronicle This extraordinary book by the country's two leading scholarly experts on the politics of the American South could accurately have been titled ""Everything you wanted to know about Southern politics, as well as everything you could ever imagine asking about it""...Their knowledge of the intricacies of particular congressional districts across the region is amazing, and their analysis of the larger partisan trends in the region makes this the most important book on Southern politics. --Stephen J. Farnsworth, Richmond Times-Dispatch The Black brothers have done it again. The Rise of Southern Republicans is without question the most important book ever written on the role of the South in Congress and the partisan consequences for our national legislature. Far and away the most comprehensive updating of the V.O. Key classic Southern Politics. This is a major work by extremely talented scholars. --Charles S. Bullock, University of Georgia The dramatic rise of the Republican Party in the South is the single most important factor in the transformation of American politics since the 1960s. Earl and Merle Black have described this process in a book that is witty, always filled with insight, and readable to the last page. The Rise of Southern Republicans is indispensable reading for anyone interested in American politics - past, present or future. --Dan T. Carter, author of The Politics of Rage: George Wallace, the Origins of the New Conservatism, and the Transformation of American Politics This marvelous book captures - with authority and readability - the big story of post-New Deal party politics in the United States. It is a surefire classic of political science and politics. --Richard F.

Mutiny on the Amistad,"This volume presents the first full-scale treatment of the only instance in history where African blacks, seized by slave dealers, won their freedom and returned home. Jones describes how, in 1839, Joseph Cinqué led a revolt on the Spanish slave ship, the Amistad, in the Caribbean. The seizure of the ship by an American naval vessel near Montauk, Long Island, the arrest of the Africans in Connecticut, and the Spanish protest against the violation of their property rights created an international controversy. The Amistad affair united Lewis Tappan and other abolitionists who put the ""law of nature"" on trial in the United States by their refusal to accept a legal system that claimed to dispense justice while permitting artificial distinctions based on race or color. The mutiny resulted in a trial before the U.S. Supreme Court that pitted former President John Quincy Adams against the federal government. Jones vividly recaptures this compelling drama--the most famous slavery case before Dred Scott--that climaxed in the court's ruling to free the captives and allow them to return to Africa.",['Howard Jones'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XIBJCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=XIBJCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mutiny+on+the+Amistad&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,1997-11-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XIBJCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],

"Women of the English Nobility and Gentry, 1066-1500 (Manchester Medieval Sources)","While there is increasing interest in the lives of medieval women, the documentary evidence for their activities remains little known. This book provides a collection of sources for an important and influential group of women in medieval England, and examines changes in their role and activities between 1066 and 1500. For most noble and gentry-women, early marriage led to responsibilities for family and household, and, in the absence of their husbands, for the family estates and retainers. Widowhood enabled them to take control of their affairs and to play an independent part in the local community and sometimes further afield. Although many women's lives followed a conventional pattern, great variety existed within family relationships, and individuality can also be seen in religious practices and patronage. Piety could take a number of different forms, whether a woman became a nun, a vowess or a noted philanthropist and benefactor to religious institutions. This volume provides a broad-ranging and accessible coverage of the role of noble women in medieval society. It highlights the significant role played by these women within their families, households, estates and communities.",['Jennifer Ward'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SW8CEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=SW8CEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Women+of+the+English+Nobility+and+Gentry,+1066-1500+(Manchester+Medieval+Sources)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Manchester University Press,2013-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SW8CEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],

Concert for piano and orchestra (Edition Peters),"John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra is one of the seminal works of the second half of the twentieth century, and the centerpiece of the middle period of Cage's output. It is a culmination of Cage's work up to that point, incorporating notation techniques he had spent the past decade developing - techniques which remain radical to this day. But despite Cage's vitality to the musical development of the twentieth century, and the Concert's centrality to his career, the work is still rarely performed and even more rarely examined in detail. In this volume, Martin Iddon and Philip Thomas provide a rich and critical examination of this enormously significant piece, tracing its many contexts and influences - particularly Schoenberg, jazz, and Cage's own compositional practice - through a wide and previously untapped range of archival sources. Iddon and Thomas explain the Concert through a reading of its many histories, especially in performance - from the legendary performer disobedience and audience disorder of its 1958 New York premiere to a no less disastrous European premiere later the same year. They also highlight the importance of the piano soloist who premiered the piece, David Tudor, and its use alongside choreographer Merce Cunningham's Antic Meet. A careful examination of an apparently bewildering piece, the book explores the critical response to the Concert's performances, re-interrogates the mythology surrounding it, and finally turns to the music itself, in all its component parts, to see what it truly asks of performers and listeners.","['Martin Iddon', 'Philip Thomas']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fMnhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fMnhDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR13&dq=Concert+for+piano+and+orchestra+(Edition+Peters)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,2020-05-14,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fMnhDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Music'],
Chicago School Pragmatism (History of American Thought),"The Chicago school of pragmatism was one of the most controversial and prominent intellectual movements of the late 1800s and early 1900s. Spanning the ferment of academic and social thought that erupted in those turbulent times in America, the Chicago pragmatists earned widespread attention and respect for many decades. They were a central force in philosophy, contesting realism and idealism for supremacy in metaphysics, epistemology and value theory. Their functionalist views formed the Chicago school of religion, which sparked intense scrutiny into the real meaning of theism, religious experience and the role of religious values in society. Their social standpoint on psychology generated the Chicago school of sociology, social psychology and symbolic interactionism that dominated the social sciences until the 1960s. Their educational philosophy was a major component of progressivism, aiming to make schools more responsive to the democratic and industrial character of the country. In economics, labour issues, civil rights and liberal politics, the Chicago school was also impossible to ignore This four-volume set focuses on the cornerstones of the thought grounding such intellectual activism: their philosophies of human nature, intelligence, values and social purpose. While other collections of the writings of the most prominent Chicago pragmatists (John Dewey, George Mead and James Tufts) offer some of their own individual work, no other collection captures the entire breadth and depth of the movement as a whole. Key writings of these major philosophers are set in their proper context of important writings of James Angell, Edward Ames, Addison Moore, and of many of their graduates who had significant careers, including Ella Flagg Young, H. Heath Bawden, Arthur Rogers, Irving King, Kate Gordon, Douglas Macintosh, William Wright, Clarence Ayres and Charles Morris. Also included are their debates with many critics, such as James Mark Baldwin, George Santayana, William Montague, Roy Wood Sellars and William Hocking. Spanning roughly fifty years, the 130 pieces are brought together from several dozens of now obscure and increasingly rare books, journals and archival sources. This collection will be indispensable for the study of American intellectual history, and especially the evolution of American philosophy, psychology, sociology, religion, education and politics. --130 articles gathered into an indispensable collection covering the entire Chicago pragmatism movement --all materials are reset, annotated, indexed and enhanced by new editorial introductions --includes a wealth of obscure, rare and hard-to-find original materials --indispensable for the study of American intellectual history, and especially the evolution of American philosophy, psychology, sociology, religion, education and politics",['John R.

In preparing this work, I have been greatly helped by a series of papers entitled, ""From Malachi to Matthew,"" which appeared a number of years ago in an English periodical now discontinued.* Dr. Grant's ""Between the Testaments"" has also been consulted, and had that volume been more in accord with a belief in the plenary inspiration of Scripture, the book now in my reader's hand might perhaps not have been prepared.

The Last Chronicle of Barset,"A clergyman’s daughter falls in love with a member of high society while her father stands accused of a terrible crime in this classic Victorian novel. The final installment of the Chronicles of Barsetshire provides a fitting close to the delightful tales author Anthony Trollope developed over the course of six unforgettable and influential novels. When Rev. Josiah Crawley, the perpetual curate of Hogglestock, is accused of stealing a check, the allegation hinders the romantic aspirations of his daughter, Grace, who hopes to marry the archdeacon’s widowed son, Maj. Henry Grantly. Grace must overcome the objections raised by Grantly’s family and win their favor while her father stands accused. The final masterwork in a groundbreaking saga that did much to elevate the status of the English novel, The Last Chronicle of Barset is one of the most beloved novels in the Barsetshire treasury, as well as Trollope’s personal favorite. The author ties together many of the loose threads from the series, turning an attentive eye to some of the Chronicles’ most beloved—and most loathed—characters.

Naked Truth,"“A formidable, addictive storyteller, Morgan provides a highly stimulating story of a midlife education in the messiness of modern sex and love. A steamy, liberating tale of self-exploration and self-love that encourages readers to ‘revel in your sexuality’” —Kirkus Reviews Leslie Morgan, bestselling author of Crazy Love and Mommy Wars, was a mom turning fifty, reeling from divorce and determined to reclaim her life. In a radical break with convention, she dedicated a year to searching for five new lovers, seeking the rapture absent in a life of minivans and mom jeans—and finding a profound new sense of self-worth. When Leslie Morgan divorced after a twenty-year marriage, both her self-esteem and romantic optimism were shattered. She was determined to avoid the cliché of the “lonely, middle-aged divorcée” lamenting her stretch marks and begging her kids to craft her online dating profile. Instead, Leslie celebrated her independence with an audacious plan: she would devote a year to seeking out five lovers in hopes of unearthing the erotic adventures and authentic connections long missing from her life. Clumsy and clueless at first, she overcame mortifying early missteps, buoyed by friends and blind faith. And so she found men at yoga class, the airport, and high school reunions—all without the torture of dating websites. Along the way she uncovered new truths about sex, aging, men, self-confidence, and what it means to be an older woman today. Packed with fearless, evocative details, The Naked Truth is a rare, unexpected, and wildly entertaining memoir about a soccer mom who rediscovers the magic of sexual and emotional connection, and the lasting gifts of reveling in your femininity at every age.",['Leslie Morgan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0S2BDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=0S2BDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Naked+Truth&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2019-05-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0S2BDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

"I Sing for I Cannot Be Silent: The Feminization of American Hymnody, 1870-1920 (Pitt Comp Literacy Culture)","Rejecting traditional notions of what constitutes art, this book brings together essays on a variety of fiber arts to recoup women's artistic practices by redefining what counts as art. Although scholars over the last twenty years have turned their attention to fiber arts, redefining the conditions, practices, and products as art, there is still much work to be done to deconstruct the stubborn patriarchal art/craft binary. With essays on a range of fiber art practices, including embroidery, knitting, crocheting, machine stitching, rug making, weaving, and quilting, this collection contributes to the ongoing scholarly redefinition of women's relationship to creative activity. Focusing on women as producers of cultural products and creators of social value, the contributors treat women as active subjects and problematize their material practices and artifacts in the complex world of textiles. Each essay also examines the ways in which needlework both performs gender and, in turn, constructs gender. Moreover, in concentrating on and theorizing material practices of textiles, these essays reorient the study of fiber arts towards a focus on process?the making of the object, including the conditions under which it was made, by whom, and for what purpose?as a way to rethink the fiber arts as social praxis.",['MaureenDaly Goggin'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dTMrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=dTMrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA47&dq=I+Sing+for+I+Cannot+Be+Silent:+The+Feminization+of+American+Hymnody,+1870-1920+(Pitt+Comp+Literacy+Culture)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Routledge,2017-07-05,"http://books.google.com/books?id=dTMrDwAAQBAJ&dq=I+Sing+for+I+Cannot+Be+Silent:+The+Feminization+of+American+Hymnody,+1870-1920+(Pitt+Comp+Literacy+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Art'],

The Spice Ingredients Cookbook,"Spices and herbs, also called seasoning, are an important part of cooking, if not the most important. They can transform an ordinary tasting dish into an incredibly delicious dish. All spices originate from plants. Some are used entirely but some plants have specific parts that are used, like the flowers, roots, barks, leaves, stems and seeds. Making spice mixes at home is a lot cheaper than buying them in the store, especially when you buy large quantities of them. Just buy a big bag or container of each individual spice and start mixing them at home. Store them in jars and you won't have to buy any spices for years to come. And with the variety of these spice mixes you'll be able to use them for anything and make everything so much more delicious! Some spices like garlic and cinnamon don't only improve the taste of the dishes but also help in preserving due to their ability to limit bacterial growth. Lots of spices, like turmeric, ginger, garlic, cloves and many more are also very healthy, they contain antioxidants and various other nutrients depending on the spice and herb. They can possess anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and immune-boosting properties. All the recipes in this book are dry spice mixes only and have been categorized according to the region where these spice mixes originated. You'll find spice blends from all over the world, including spice mixes for desserts. So go stock up on some spices and get ready to taste an amazing array of new flavors in your home cooking.",['Julie Hatfield'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mA8mjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mA8mjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Spice+Ingredients+Cookbook&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2016-01-05,http://books.google.com/books?id=mA8mjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Spice+Ingredients+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api,,

IN THE DARK OF THE HEART Songs of Meera: A new Translation of the Much-Loved Songs of the Sixteenth-Century Poet-Saint of India,"What role have translations from Hindi literary works played in shaping and transforming our knowledge about India? In this book, renowned scholars, translators and Hindi writers from India, Europe, and the United States offer their approaches to this question. Their articles deal with the political, cultural, and linguistic criteria germane to the selection and translation of Hindi works, the nature of the enduring links between India and Europe, and the reception of translated texts, particularly through the perspective of book history. More personal essays, both on the writing process itself or on the practice of translation, complete the volume and highlight the plurality of voices that are inherent to any translation. As the outcome of an international symposium held at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2008, India in Translation through Hindi Literature engages in the building of critical histories of the encounter between India and the «West», the use and impact of translations in this context, and Hindi literature and culture in connection to English (post)colonial power, literature and culture.","['Maya Burger', 'Nicola Pozza']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=obTJsLl_YTQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=obTJsLl_YTQC&pg=PA223&dq=IN+THE+DARK+OF+THE+HEART+Songs+of+Meera:+A+new+Translation+of+the+Much-Loved+Songs+of+the+Sixteenth-Century+Poet-Saint+of+India&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Peter Lang,2010,http://books.google.com/books?id=obTJsLl_YTQC&dq=IN+THE+DARK+OF+THE+HEART+Songs+of+Meera:+A+new+Translation+of+the+Much-Loved+Songs+of+the+Sixteenth-Century+Poet-Saint+of+India&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

It not only illuminated the private life of this public thinker, but suggested that his previously published works could be read very differently. Louis Althusser is the first major overview of Althusser's work since the publication in French of thousands of pages of essays, books and letters unknown before 1990, and makes a strong case for a radical reconsideration of his work in the light of this new material. Focusing particularly on Althusser's writings on art, theatre and literature (as well as those of Althusser's collaborator, Pierre Macherey), Warren Montag traces the contradictory development of Althusser's thought from the early sixties to his autobiography.

"The Varieties of Metaphysical Poetry: The Clark Lectures at Trinity College, Cambridge, 1926, and the Turnbull Lectures at the Johns Hopkins University, 1933","The famed series of Trinity College and Johns Hopkins lectures in which the Nobel Prize winner explored history, poetry, and philosophy. While a student at Harvard in the early years of the twentieth century, T. S. Eliot immersed himself in the verse of Dante, Donne, and the nineteenth-century French poet Jules Laforgue. His study of the relation of thought and feeling in these poets led Eliot, as a poet and critic living in London, to formulate an original theory of the poetry generally termed “metaphysical”—philosophical and intellectual poetry that revels in startlingly unconventional imagery. Eliot came to perceive a gradual “disintegration of the intellect” following three “metaphysical moments” of European civilization—the thirteenth, seventeenth, and nineteenth centuries. The theory is at once a provocative prism through which to view Western intellectual and literary history and an exceptional insight into Eliot’s own intellectual development. This annotated edition includes the eight Clark Lectures on metaphysical poetry that Eliot delivered at Trinity College in Cambridge in 1926, and their revision and extension for his three Turnbull Lectures at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1933. They reveal in great depth the historical currents of poetry and philosophy that shaped Eliot’s own metaphysical moment in the twentieth century.",['T. S.

The world needs to see the manifestation of the presence of God. Believers need the ministry of the body of Christ through spiritual gifts. The Gifts of the Spirit reveals how we can fulfill both of these needs—practically and powerfully.,['Derek Prince'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S-31BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=S-31BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Gifts+of+the+Holy+Spirit&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Whitaker House,2007-06-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S-31BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],5.0

Heed the Thunder (The Armchair Detective Library),"In the rural town of Verdon, Nebraska, in the early days of the 20th century, you can't go ten feet without running into one of the Fargos. So, Grant Fargo argues to his grandfather Lincoln, it's perfectly all right that he's desperately in love with his first cousin, Bella-she's the only source of intelligent conversation for miles, and in a town like Verdon, it would be hard ""not"" to end up with a relative of one kind or another. Before it all plays out, men will be murdered, jailed, tarred and feathered or worse, and while everyone in the Fargo clan would kill for the family deeds, God might just end up with them instead. In HEED THE THUNDER, one of Thompson's earlier works, Thompson's signature style collides with a sweeping picaresque of the American prairie, in a multigenerational saga that's one part Steinbeck, two parts Dostoyevsky, and all Jim Thompson.",['Jim Thompson'],,http://books.google.com/books?id=0uZCPgAACAAJ&dq=Heed+the+Thunder+(The+Armchair+Detective+Library)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1946,http://books.google.com/books?id=0uZCPgAACAAJ&dq=Heed+the+Thunder+(The+Armchair+Detective+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['City and town life'],1.0
Never Call Retreat,"New York Times bestselling authors Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen conclude their inventive trilogy with this remarkable answer to the great ""what if"" of the American Civil War: Could the South have indeed won? After his great victories at Gettysburg and Union Mills, General Robert E. Lee's attempt to bring the war to a final conclusion by attacking Washington, D.C., fails. However, in securing Washington, the remnants of the valiant Union Army of the Potomac, under the command of the impetuous General Dan Sickles, is trapped and destroyed. For Lincoln there is only one hope left: that General Ulysses S. Grant can save the Union cause. It is now August 22, 1863. Lincoln and Grant are facing a collapse of political will to continue the fight to preserve the Union. Lee, desperately short of manpower, must conserve his remaining strength while maneuvering for the killing blow that will take Grant's army out of the fight and, at last, bring a final and complete victory for the South. Pursuing the remnants of the defeated Army of the Potomac up to the banks of the Susquehanna, Lee is caught off balance when news arrives that General Ulysses S. Grant, in command of more than seventy thousand men, has crossed that same river, a hundred miles to the northwest at Harrisburg. As General Grant brings his Army of the Susquehanna into Maryland, Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia maneuvers for position. Grant first sends General George Armstrong Custer on a mad dash to block Lee's path toward Frederick and with it control of the crucial B&O railroad, which moves troops and supplies. The two armies finally collide in Central Maryland, and a bloody week-long battle ensues along the banks of Monocacy Creek. This must be the ""final"" battle for both sides. In Never Call Retreat, Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen bring all of their critically acclaimed talents to bear in what is destined to become an immediate classic.","['Newt Gingrich', 'William R.

Talking to Your Child About God: A Book for Families of All Faiths (Book Club Edition),"Christian parenting is hard work--and it's getting harder. Parents have a deep desire to pass on their faith, but fear that today's increasingly skeptical and hostile world will eventually lead their kids to reject the truth of Christianity. That leaves many parents feeling overwhelmed--uncertain of what they can do to help their children, given the difficulty and extent of the faith challenges they will face. This practical and timely resource gives parents the confidence of knowing what to discuss with their children and how to discuss it in order to facilitate impactful conversations that will form the basis of a lifelong faith. In a friendly, parent-to-parent voice, Natasha Crain identifies 30 specific conversations about God that parents must have with their children, organizing them under the categories of - the existence of God - science and God - the nature of God - believing in God - the difference God makes Chapters are sequenced in a curriculum-oriented way to provide a cumulative learning experience, making this book a flexible resource for use in multiple settings: homes, church classes, youth groups, small groups, private Christian schools, and homeschools. Every chapter has a step-by-step conversation guide with discussion questions and tips, and content is readily adaptable for use with kids of any age (elementary through high school).

African American Children: A Self-Empowerment Approach to Modifying Behavior Problems and Preventing Academic Failure,,,,,,,,,
Balance Sheet Recession: Japan's Struggle with Uncharted Economics and its Global Implications,"In this groundbreaking book, leading international economist, Richard Koo argues that far from being the sick man of Asia, Japan is suffering from a temporary but highly unusual economic aberration. Economists and business commentators have always assumed that the majority of companies in any economy are forward looking and are trying to maximize profits. They never considered the possibility that a vast majority of companies may be placing their highest priorities on minimizing debt in order to repair their balance sheets. But that remote possibility has been the reality in Japan for the past decade, and more recently in many other countries including at least a part of the US. Balance Sheet Recession argues that contrary to popular belief, it is this massive shift in corporate behavior, instead of structural problems, that is the root cause of both the deflation and the non-performing loan problems that have troubled Japan for so long. It argues that when the causality runs from the corporate balance sheet problems to deflation and banking problems, a highly unconventional policy response is needed to stabilize the economy. After all, the last time anything similar has happened was the 1930s in the US. Richard Koo's experience in dealing with both the US banking crisis of the early 1980s and the Japanese balance sheet and banking problems of the last ten years makes him unique qualified to comment on this situation. He clearly explains how such a recession can happen in any economy following an asset price bubble, and how best to deal with it.",['Richard Koo'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dkS5AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=dkS5AAAAIAAJ&q=Balance+Sheet+Recession:+Japan%27s+Struggle+with+Uncharted+Economics+and+its+Global+Implications&dq=Balance+Sheet+Recession:+Japan%27s+Struggle+with+Uncharted+Economics+and+its+Global+Implications&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,John Wiley & Sons Incorporated,2003-10-24,http://books.google.com/books?id=dkS5AAAAIAAJ&dq=Balance+Sheet+Recession:+Japan%27s+Struggle+with+Uncharted+Economics+and+its+Global+Implications&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],

Automation,"From the global automation leaders at Accenture—the first-ever comprehensive blueprint for how to use and scale AI-powered intelligent automation in the enterprise to gain competitive advantage through faster speed to market, improved product quality, higher efficiency, and an elevated customer experience. Many companies were already implementing limited levels of automation when the pandemic hit. But the need to rapidly change business processes and how organizations work resulted in the compression of a decade’s worth of digital transformation into a matter of months. Technology suddenly became the essential element for rapid organizational change and the creation of 360-degree value benefiting all stakeholders. Businesses are faced with the imperative to embrace that change or risk being left behind. In The Automation Advantage, global enterprise technology and automation veterans Bhaskar Ghosh, Rajendra Prasad, and Gayathri Pallail give business leaders and managers the action plan they need to execute a strategic agenda that enables them to quickly and confidently scale their automation and AI initiatives. This practical and highly accessible implementation guide answers leaders’ burning questions, such as: How do I identify and prioritize automation opportunities? How do I assess my legacy systems and data issues? How do I derive full value out of my technology investments and automation efforts? How can I inspire my employees to embrace change and the new opportunities presented by automation? The Automation Advantage goes beyond optimizing process to using AI to transform almost any business activity in any industry to make it faster, more streamlined, cost efficient, and customer-focused—vastly improving overall productivity and performance. Featuring case studies of successful automation solutions, this indispensable road map includes guiding principles for technology, governance, culture, and leadership change. It offers a human-centric approach to AI and automation that leads to sustainable transformation and measurable business results.","['Bhaskar Ghosh', 'Rajendra Prasad', 'Gayathri Pallail']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DdM7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=DdM7EAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Automation&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,McGraw Hill Professional,2021-12-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DdM7EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],

The Wiccan's Dictionary Of Prophecy And Omens,"THE WICCAN’S DICTIONARY OF PROPHECY AND OMENS Divination—the art of obtaining knowledge of the future or of secret things—has played an important role in ancient cultures and religions as well as in modern times. It was once a method of sacred communication with the spirit world and a way to determine the will of the gods by means of visions and predictions. In the present age, divination, including astrology, palmistry, and the I Ching, continues to be a popular method of looking into the future or past, as well as revealing that which was once unknown. In fact, a large number of our contemporary customs and superstitions are remnants of the once-powerful divinatory rituals of the ancient pagan religions. The Wiccan's Dictionary of Prophecy and Omens details over two hundred methods of divination, from those used in antiquity to those in use today. It traces the history of these practices and provides examples of nearly every known divinatory art.

Although the ""Lost Centuries"" between AD400 and 600 suffer from a scarcity of written sources, and only two writers, King Alfred and the Venerable Bede, dominate our understanding of later times, the authors have created a rich and thought-provoking account of the stormy era when Britain became Christian and sustained several waves of Viking invaders. A single nation, they suggest, slowly emerged from the rivalries and fluctuating fortunes of separate kingdoms like Mercia, Wessex and East Anglia. Major figures such as Offa, Alfred, Edgar and Cnut are discussed in detail, while the stunning illustrations convey the immense achievements of Anglo-Saxon centuries were 'simply a barbarous prelude to better things'.","['James Campbell', 'Eric John', 'Patrick Wormald']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KoJPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=KoJPEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Anglo-Saxons&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,1991-08-06,http://books.google.com/books?id=KoJPEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Anglo-Saxons&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],2.0

Get wild with paint!: Easy step-by-step instructions to paint jungle prints,"NATURE IN ART, STILL LIFE, LANDSCAPES & SEASCAPES. Including wild animals in our hugely successful Ready to Paint series is a natural development since the successful launch of Cats and Kittens and Dogs and Puppies. Animals are an attractive prospect for many artists, but some are put off owing to the perceived difficulty of drawing them. The Ready to Paint series solves this neatly by providing pull-out tracings from which to work. There are five beautiful projects, each accompanied by a full-size tracing of the initial drawing. 200 step-by-step photographs accompany the easy-to-follow instructions, and a dedicated section on the materials used is also included. This is a great way to learn how to paint these inspiring animals in acrylics and there is plenty to appeal to more experienced painters too. As well as the five projects, there are four further finished paintings to inspire the reader, one of which also has a full-sized tracing, making six tracings altogether.",['Angela Gaughan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JUJ9mwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=JUJ9mwEACAAJ&dq=Get+wild+with+paint!:+Easy+step-by-step+instructions+to+paint+jungle+prints&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Search PressLtd,2014-03-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=JUJ9mwEACAAJ&dq=Get+wild+with+paint!:+Easy+step-by-step+instructions+to+paint+jungle+prints&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Art'],

Cassell Military Classics: To Win A War: 1918 The Year Of Victory,"Marshal Foch, the Generalissimo of the Allied Armies during the last stages of the First World War, commenting on the victories won during the Hundred Days when the Germans were driven back on the Western Front, said Never at any time in history has the British army achieved greater results in attack than in this unbroken offensive. The scale, speed and success of this offensive have provided historians with fertile ground for interpretation and debate. How did the British Expeditionary Force, having endured the bitter disappointments and heavy losses at Aubers Ridge, Loos, the Somme, Passchendaele, Cambrai and during the German spring offensives of 1918 turn the tide of the war and comprehensively defeat the enemy in the field? This is the fascinating question that Michael Senior tackles in this lucid and thought-provoking study. He considers the reasons for the stunning British victories and examines the factors that underpinned the eventual success of the BEF. In particular he shows how tactical and technical developments evolved during the course of the war and merged in a way that gave the British a decisive advantage during the final months of the fighting. Innovations in guns and gunnery, in shells, aircraft and tanks, and a massive increase in industrial output, played key parts, as did the continuous process of adaptation, experimentation and invention that went on throughout the war years. The result was an army that could take advantage of the unprecedented opportunity presented by the failure of the German spring offensive of 1918. Michael Senior provides a challenging and controversial analysis of the underlying reasons for the success of the BEF. It is essential reading for anyone who is keen to learn about the extraordinary development of the British army throughout the war  and to understand why, and how, the Germans were beaten.",['Michael  Senior'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K1auDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=K1auDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA234&dq=Cassell+Military+Classics:+To+Win+A+War:+1918+The+Year+Of+Victory&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Pen and Sword,2016-10-30,http://books.google.com/books?id=K1auDQAAQBAJ&dq=Cassell+Military+Classics:+To+Win+A+War:+1918+The+Year+Of+Victory&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

My Soul is a Woman: The Feminine in Islam,"An internationally acclaimed scholar, who has dedicated more than fifty years of her life to understanding the Islamic world.Annemarie Schimmel examines a much-misunderstood feature of Islam: the role of women. Schimmel is critical of those--especially Western feminists--who take Islam to task without taking the time to comprehend the cultures, language, and traditions of the many societies in which Islam is the majority religion.Shattering stereotypes, Schimmel reconstructs an important but little-known chapter of Islamic spirituality. With copius examples, she shows the clear equality of women and meni nthe conception of the Prophet Muhammad, the Quran, the feminine language of the mystical tradition, and the role of holy mothers and unmarried women as manifestations of God.This work is studded with luminous texts from Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and particularly Indo-Muslim cultures, which reveal how physical love can give expression to the highest forms of mysticism.",['Annemarie Schimmel'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QPWjzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QPWjzgEACAAJ&dq=My+Soul+is+a+Woman:+The+Feminine+in+Islam&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Continuum,2003-02-25,http://books.google.com/books?id=QPWjzgEACAAJ&dq=My+Soul+is+a+Woman:+The+Feminine+in+Islam&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],1.0

Technics and Civilization,"Technics and Civilization first presented its compelling history of the machine and critical study of its effects on civilization in 1934—before television, the personal computer, and the Internet even appeared on our periphery. Drawing upon art, science, philosophy, and the history of culture, Lewis Mumford explained the origin of the machine age and traced its social results, asserting that the development of modern technology had its roots in the Middle Ages rather than the Industrial Revolution. Mumford sagely argued that it was the moral, economic, and political choices we made, not the machines that we used, that determined our then industrially driven economy. Equal parts powerful history and polemic criticism, Technics and Civilization was the first comprehensive attempt in English to portray the development of the machine age over the last thousand years—and to predict the pull the technological still holds over us today. “The questions posed in the first paragraph of Technics and Civilization still deserve our attention, nearly three quarters of a century after they were written.”—Journal of Technology and Culture","['Lewis Mumford', 'Langdon Winner']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PU7PktesGUoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PU7PktesGUoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Technics+and+Civilization&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Chicago Press,2010-10-30,http://books.google.com/books?id=PU7PktesGUoC&dq=Technics+and+Civilization&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

Lesbians Are So Chic (Listen Up!),"Uncomfortable close encounters with 'real' lesbians such as k.d. or Martina, the production of absolutely fake lesbianism a la Madonna, the life and death of Beth from Brookside, the now-you-see-it-now-you-don't lesbian relationship in Eastenders, Roseanne's quick affirmation of her heterosexuality following 'the lesbian kiss', the overt heterosexualization of the lesbian narrative in Thelma and Louise or Fried Green Tomatoes and the cooptation of the 'lesbian look' on the streets and catwalks of Paris, London and New York all attest to the superficiality of dominant media's mis-representation of lesbians and lesbianism. Cottingham contests the lesbian significance of the mainstream media's 'lesbian chic' phenomenon which, she argues, is less a manifestation of lesbian cultural power than a commodification of lesbianism whose primary purpose is to disempower and marginalize lesbians, and all women, who threaten the existing political structure. The author suggests that the threat actual lesbians (as opposed to their mass media simulacra) pose to the social and sexual economy of contemporary society should be refocused into a radical new definition of feminist politics.",['Laura Cottingham'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TWgbAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=TWgbAAAAYAAJ&q=Lesbians+Are+So+Chic+(Listen+Up!)&dq=Lesbians+Are+So+Chic+(Listen+Up!)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Burns & Oates,1996,http://books.google.com/books?id=TWgbAAAAYAAJ&dq=Lesbians+Are+So+Chic+(Listen+Up!)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],

And how can job interviews be structured so that they are fair and effective? The Psychology of Job Interviews is the first book to provide an accessible and concise overview of what we know. Based on empirical research rather than second hand advice, it discusses the strategies and tactics that both applicants and interviewers can use to make their interviews more successful; from how to make a good first impression to how to decide which candidate is the best fit for the role. Illustrated with examples throughout, the book guides job applicants on how best to prepare for and perform in an interview, and provides managers with best-practice advice in selecting the right candidate.

Thirty Tons a Day: The Rough-Riding Education of a Neophyte Racetrack Operator,"Just weeks after Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers, Larry Doby joined Robinson in breaking the color barrier in the major leagues when he became the first black player to integrate the American League, signing with the Cleveland Indians in July 1947. Doby went on to be a seven-time All-Star center fielder who led the Indians to two pennants. In many respects Robinson and Doby were equals in their baseball talent and experiences and had remarkably similar playing careers: both were well-educated, well-spoken World War II veterans and both had played spectacularly, albeit briefly, in the Negro Leagues. Like Robinson, Doby suffered brickbats, knock-down pitches, spit in his face, and other forms of abuse and discrimination. Doby was also a pioneering manager, becoming the second black manager after Frank Robinson. Well into the 1950s Doby was the only African American All-Star in the American League during a period in which fifteen black players became National League All-Stars. Why is Doby largely forgotten as a central figure in baseball’s integration? Why has he not been accorded his rightful place in baseball history? Greatness in the Shadows attempts to answer these questions, bringing Doby’s story to life and sharing his achievements and firsts with a new generation.",['Douglas M.

The Simple Science of Flight,"An investigation into how machines and living creatures fly, and of the similarities between butterflies and Boeings, paper airplanes and plovers. From the smallest gnat to the largest aircraft, all things that fly obey the same aerodynamic principles. In The Simple Science of Flight, Henk Tennekes investigates just how machines and creatures fly: what size wings they need, how much energy is required for their journeys, how they cross deserts and oceans, how they take off, climb, and soar. Fascinated by the similarities between nature and technology, Tennekes offers an introduction to flight that teaches by association. Swans and Boeings differ in numerous ways, but they follow the same aerodynamic principles. Biological evolution and its technical counterpart exhibit exciting parallels. What makes some airplanes successful and others misfits? Why does the Boeing 747 endure but the Concorde now seem a fluke? Tennekes explains the science of flight through comparisons, examples, equations, and anecdotes. The new edition of this popular book has been thoroughly revised and much expanded. Highlights of the new material include a description of the incredible performance of bar-tailed godwits (7,000 miles nonstop from Alaska to New Zealand), an analysis of the convergence of modern jetliners (from both Boeing and Airbus), a discussion of the metabolization of energy featuring Lance Armstrong, a novel treatment of the aerodynamics of drag and trailing vortices, and an emphasis throughout on evolution, in nature and in engineering. Tennekes draws on new evidence on bird migration, new wind-tunnel studies, and data on new airliners. And his analysis of the relative efficiency of planes, trains, and automobiles is newly relevant. (On a cost-per-seat scale, a 747 is more efficient than a passenger car.)",['Henk Tennekes'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lt4PQPDhX5YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=lt4PQPDhX5YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Simple+Science+of+Flight&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,MIT Press,2009-09-04,http://books.google.com/books?id=lt4PQPDhX5YC&dq=The+Simple+Science+of+Flight&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Science'],
"Forging the Darksword: The Darksword Trilogy, Volume 1","From the bestselling authors of The Rose of the Prophet and The Death Gate Cycle, the first in a majestic saga of magic, fantasy, and adventure In the enchanted realm of Merilon, magic is life. Born without magical abilities and denied his birthright, Joram is left for dead. Yet he grows to manhood in a remote country village, hiding his lack of powers only through constant vigilance and ever more skillful sleight-of-hand. Forced to kill a man in self-defense, Joram can keep his secret from the townspeople no longer: he has no magic, no life. Fleeing to the Outlands, Joram joins the outlawed Technologists, who practice the long forbidden arts of science. Here he meets the scholarly catalyst Saryon, who has been sent on a special mission to hunt down a mysterious “dead man” and instead finds himself in a battle of wits and power with a renegade warlock of the dark Duuk-tsarith caste. Together, Joram and Saryon begin their quest toward a greater destiny—a destiny that begins with the discovery of the secret books that will enable them to overthrow the evil usurper Blachloch . . . and forge the powerful magic-absorbing Darksword.","['Margaret Weis', 'Tracy Hickman']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yaX7eBKTeecC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=yaX7eBKTeecC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Forging+the+Darksword:+The+Darksword+Trilogy,+Volume+1&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Spectra,2010-06-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yaX7eBKTeecC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],6.0

The Dog Who Knew Too Much (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries),"The path to enlightenment is fraught with danger when Greenwich Village PI Rachel Alexander and her pit bull, Dash, investigate the death of a tai chi practitioner Did she jump or was she pushed? Devastated by the loss of their only child, David and Marsha Jacobs hire Rachel to find out why Lisa leaped to her death from the fifth-floor window of her martial arts studio. The tai chi instructor, who was studying to be a Zen Buddhist priest, seemed to have it all: beauty, brains, a vocation she adored, a sexy lover—and her beautiful, sad-eyed Akita, who may have been the only witness to her death and is still grieving the loss of his mistress. Refusing to believe that Lisa would abandon her beloved pet—and with only a suspicious suicide note to go on—Rachel and her canine assistant, Dash, hit the streets of downtown New York, retracing the dead woman’s steps to figure out whether she was yin to a killer’s yang.

Mirrors,"Throughout his career, Eduardo Galeano has turned our understanding of history and reality on its head. Isabelle Allende said his works “invade the reader's mind, to persuade him or her to surrender to the charm of his writing and power of his idealism.” Mirrors, Galeano's most ambitious project since Memory of Fire, is an unofficial history of the world seen through history's unseen, unheard, and forgotten. As Galeano notes: “Official history has it that Vasco Núñez de Balboa was the first man to see, from a summit in Panama, the two oceans at once. Were the people who lived there blind??” Recalling the lives of artists, writers, gods, and visionaries, from the Garden of Eden to twenty-first-century New York, of the black slaves who built the White House and the women erased by men's fears, and told in hundreds of kaleidoscopic vignettes, Mirrors is a magic mosaic of our humanity.",['Eduardo Galeano'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WRkbRyxJ428C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=WRkbRyxJ428C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mirrors&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bold Type Books,2009-05-26,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WRkbRyxJ428C&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0
The First and Second Epistles to the Thessalonians (The New International Commentary on the New Testament),"In The First and Second Letters to the Thessalonians Gordon Fee?s first aim is a fresh exposition of the biblical text. He shows the reader what is in the text, then what was meant by the text and what it means. Fee reveals the logic of each argument or narrative before moving on to the details of each verse. He concludes each section with a theological or applicational reflection on the meaning of the text today. / In order to make his work not only useful, but also understandable, Fee uses diagrams of sentence structure, italics for emphasis, and a listing of points. He explores authorship, the city of Thessalonica, and the occasion for writing for each epistle, restoring 2 Thessalonians to the place it deserves as a full companion to the first letter, rather than merely a tagalong to 1 Thessalonians. / Like Fee?s previous volumes in this series, this insightful, thoroughly readable commentary on Paul?s two letters of thanksgiving, information, encouragement, and exhortation to the separated, suffering community of Gentile converts in Thessalonica is destined to become the premier work on these books. / ?Fee could not be boring even if he tried.

"Algeria, 1830-2000: A Short History","A particularly vicious and bloody civil war has racked Algeria for a decade. Amnesty International notes that since 1992, in a population of 28 million, 80,000 people have been reported killed, and the actual total is almost certainly higher. This terrible war overshadows Algeria's long and complex history and its prominence on the world economic stage—second in size among African nations, Algeria has the longest Mediterranean coastline and contains the world's fifth-largest natural gas reserves. Algeria, 1830-2000 is a comprehensive narrative history of the country. Benjamin Stora, widely recognized as the leading expert on Algeria, presents the story of this turbulent area from the start of formal French colonialism in the early nineteenth century, through the prolonged war for independence in the latter 1950s, to the internal strife of the present day. This book adapts and updates three short volumes published originally in French by La Découverte. For this English edition, Stora has written a new introductory chapter on Algeria's colonial period (1830-1954) and has revised the final section to bring the volume up to date.",['Benjamin Stora'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x_-5XTVKW08C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=x_-5XTVKW08C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Algeria,+1830-2000:+A+Short+History&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Cornell University Press,2004,"http://books.google.com/books?id=x_-5XTVKW08C&dq=Algeria,+1830-2000:+A+Short+History&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],1.0

Tupai: A Field Study of Bornean Treeshrews (Organisms and Environments),"Treeshrews suffer from chronic mistaken identity: they are not shrews, and most are not found in trees. These squirrel-sized, brownish mammals with large, dark, lashless eyes were at one time thought to be primates. Even though most scientists now believe them to belong in their own mammalian order, Scandentia, they still are thought to resemble some of the earliest mammals, which lived alongside the dinosaurs. This book describes the results of the first comparative study of the ecology of treeshrews in the wild. Noted tropical mammalogist Louise H. Emmons conducted this pathbreaking study in the rainforests of Borneo as she tracked and observed six species of treeshrews. Emmons meticulously describes their habitat, diet, nesting habits, home range, activity patterns, social behavior, and many other facets of their lives. She also discusses a particularly interesting aspect of treeshrews: their enigmatic parental care system, which is unique among mammals.",['Louise H.

"Battle of Crecy, 1346","The Battle of Crecy was the first major land battle of the Hundred Years War (1337-1453). It pitted the French army, then considered the best in Europe, and their miscellaneous allies against the English under King Edward III and the 'Black Prince', who as yet had no great military reputation; this was the battle where he 'won his spurs'. The Genoese crossbowmen were outshot by the English longbows and the pattern was set for the rest of the day: the French cavalry were committed piecemeal in fruitless charges against strong English positions, losing perhaps 10,000 men in the course of the fighting. After almost a millennium in which cavalry had dominated the field of battle, the infantryman, and particularly the longbowman, now ruled supreme.",['David Nicolle'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=urDy8wKgMhgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=urDy8wKgMhgC&q=Battle+of+Crecy,+1346&dq=Battle+of+Crecy,+1346&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Osprey Publishing,2000-06-25,"http://books.google.com/books?id=urDy8wKgMhgC&dq=Battle+of+Crecy,+1346&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],2.0
Against Ethics: Contributions to a Poetics of Obligation with Constant Reference to Deconstruction (Studies in Continental Thought),"A brilliant and witty postmodern critique of ethics, framed as a contemporary restaging of Kierkegaard’s Fear and Trembling. John D. Caputo undertakes a passionate, poetic, and satiric search for the basis of an ethics in the postmodern situation. Restaging Kierkegaard’s Fear and Trembling, Caputo defends the notion of obligation without ethics, of responsibility without the support of ethical foundations. Retelling the story of Abraham and Isaac, he strikes the pose of a postmodern-day Johannes de Silentio, accompanied by communications from such startling figures as Johanna de Silentio, Felix Sineculpa, and Magdalena de la Cruz. In dialogue with the thought of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Derrida, and Lyotard, Caputo forges a challenging, original account of what is possible and what is not possible for a continentalist ethics today. “Against Ethics is a bold work. . . . A counterethics whose multiple voices will be heard long after the trivializing arguments of many analytic ethicists have vanished and the arcane formulations of many postmoderns have been jettisoned.” —Edith Wyschogrod “Caputo provides a brilliant new analysis of the limits of ethics. . . . Essential reading for anyone concerned with the philosophical issues raised in postmodernity.” —Drucilla Cornell “One of the most important works on philosophical ethics written in recent years. . . . Caputo speaks with a passion and concern that are rare in academic philosophy.” —Mark C. Taylor “Against Ethics is beautifully written, clever, learned, thought-provoking, and even inspiring.” —Theological Studies “Writing in the form of his ideas, Caputo offers the reader a truly exquisite reading experience. . . . His iconic style mirrors a truly refreshing honesty that draws the reader in to play.” —Quarterly Journal of Speech",['John D.

"Meant to Be (Diary of a Teenage Girl: Kim, Book 2)","This Is Now It’s Kim’s senior year and, while everyone’s looking forward to graduation, she’s got so much going on she can barely make it through the day. Natalie, pregnant with Benjamin O’Conner’s baby, believes it’s God’s will for them to marry, and Ben sees it as his Christian responsibility to do so. Major red flag? He doesn’t love her. Then–surprise! Kim’s birth mother in Korea sends her an intriguing letter, making Kim question her reluctance to get to know another “mom.” And what about Maya? Is God calling Kim and her father to open their hearts and home to Kim’s biracial cousin whose mother was just sentenced to five years in state prison? Kim has been through so much already, but that was then … Does she have enough faith for now? Saturday, November 11 I’ve talked to Nat twice this week. But only on the phone. Both times she just glossed over what happened last weekend. She told me everything was “fine.” But without any details. It was the kind of reassurance that isn’t reassuring at all. I know she’s covering something up. That was then...Kim Peterson has had a lot going on the past few years: writing a teen advice column, finding a new faith, dating and breaking up for the first time, losing her mom to cancer...Kim has learned to turn it all over to God day by day, relying on Him like she never has before. Now Kim’s best friend, Nat, is pregnant and soon to be married to Ben O’Conner, Caitlin’s younger brother. Nat is starry-eyed, believing that once she and Ben are married, God will bless them and everything will work out because they’re doing the right thing. Kim’s not so sure. Is marriage the only solution for two seventeen-year-olds with a baby on the way? Why won’t they consider adoption? Kim knows about that firsthand–and is about to find out even more… Reader’s guide included Story Behind the Book “In book four, Kim’s life is still shadowed by the loss of her mother, but her faith is deepening. My best friend lost her mother to cancer in high school, and I was very involved in counseling, encouraging, and praying with my friend as she worked through her grief. That experience helped me write Kim’s story from an insider’s perspective.” – Melody Carlson",['Melody Carlson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=METGJvvrNJkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=METGJvvrNJkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Meant+to+Be+(Diary+of+a+Teenage+Girl:+Kim,+Book+2)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Multnomah,2010-04-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=METGJvvrNJkC&source=gbs_api,['Young Adult Fiction'],4.0

Book Indexing.,"Since 1994, Nancy Mulvany's Indexing Books has been the gold standard for thousands of professional indexers, editors, and authors. This long-awaited second edition, expanded and completely updated, will be equally revered. Like its predecessor, this edition of Indexing Books offers comprehensive, reliable treatment of indexing principles and practices relevant to authors and indexers alike. In addition to practical advice, the book presents a big-picture perspective on the nature and purpose of indexes and their role in published works. New to this edition are discussions of ""information overload"" and the role of the index, open-system versus closed-system indexing, electronic submission and display of indexes, and trends in software development, among other topics. Mulvany is equally comfortable focusing on the nuts and bolts of indexing—how to determine what is indexable, how to decide the depth of an index, and how to work with publisher instructions—and broadly surveying important sources of indexing guidelines such as The Chicago Manual of Style, Sun Microsystems, Oxford University Press, NISO TR03, and ISO 999. Authors will appreciate Mulvany's in-depth consideration of the costs and benefits of preparing one's own index versus hiring a professional, while professional indexers will value Mulvany's insights into computer-aided indexing. Helpful appendixes include resources for indexers, a worksheet for general index specifications, and a bibliography of sources to consult for further information on a range of topics. Indexing Books is both a practical guide and a manifesto about the vital role of the human-crafted index in the Information Age. As the standard indexing reference, it belongs on the shelves of everyone involved in writing and publishing nonfiction books.",['Nancy C.

Fifty Years of the Texas Observer,"For the past five decades the Texas Observer has been an essential voice in Texas culture and politics, championing honest government, civil rights, labor, and the environment, while providing a platform for many of the state’s most passionate and progressive voices. Included are ninety-one selections from Roy Bedichek, Lou Dubose, Ronnie Dugger, Dagoberto Gilb, Jim Hightower, Molly Ivins, Larry McMurtry, Maury Maverick Jr., Willie Morris, Debbie Nathan, and others. To mark the Observer’s fiftieth anniversary, Char Miller has selected a cross section of the best work to appear in its pages. Not only does the collection pay homage to an important alternative voice in Texas journalism, it also serves as a progressive chronicle of a half-century of life in the Lone Star State—a state that has spawned three presidents in the last forty years. If Texas is, as some say, a crucible for national politics, then Fifty Years of the Texas Observer can be read as a casebook for issues that concern citizens in all fifty states.

A Karenina Companion offers a wealth of information, including a great deal that has previously not been available in English, for the scholarly and literary appreciation of this great novel. Chapter 1 is a biographical introduction and Chapter 2 an examination of the way in which the novel was composed. In Chapter 3 the author brings together Tolstoi’s own substantial comments on his work. Chapter 4 adduces the main differences between the latest edition of the text and what has been the standard edition for over 50 years. Chapter 5 outlines what Tolstoi was reading as he was writing the novel. The final chapter provides a survey of significant secondary literature, with English-language works listed in appendices.

The Evolution of the Airline Industry,"Since the enactment of the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, questions that had been at the heart of the ongoing debate about the industry for eighty years gained a new intensity: Is there enough competition among airlines to ensure that passengers do not pay excessive fares? Can an unregulated airline industry be profitable? Is air travel safe? While economic regulation provided a certain stability for both passengers and the industry, deregulation changed everything. A new fare structure emerged; travelers faced a variety of fares and travel restrictions; and the offerings changed frequently. In the last fifteen years, the airline industry's earnings have fluctuated wildly. New carriers entered the industry, but several declared bankruptcy, and Eastern, Pan Am, and Midway were liquidated. As financial pressures mounted, fears have arisen that air safety is being compromised by carriers who cut costs by skimping on maintenance and hiring inexperienced pilots. Deregulation itself became an issue with many critics calling for a return to some form of regulation. In this book, Steven A. Morrison and Clifford Winston assert that all too often public discussion of the issues of airline competition, profitability, and safety take place without a firm understanding of the facts. The policy recommendations that emerge frequently ignore the long-run evolution of the industry and its capacity to solve its own problems. This book provides a comprehensive profile of the industry as it has evolved, both before and since deregulation. The authors identify the problems the industry faces, assess their severity and their underlying causes, and indicate whether government policy can play an effective role in improving performance. They also develop a basis for understanding the industry's evolution and how the industry will eventually adapt to the unregulated economic environment. Morrison and Winston maintain that although the airline industry has not reached long-run equilibrium, its evolution is proceeding in a positive direction—one that will preserve and possibly enhance the benefits of deregulation to travelers and carriers. They conclude that the federal government's primary policy objective should be to expand the benefits from unregulated market forces to international travel.

The Spiritual Gifts Handbook: The Complete Guide to Discovering and Using Your Spiritual Gift,"Foundational Teaching from a Charismatic Healing Minister and a Catholic Scholar International healing minister Randy Clark teams up with Mary Healy, a respected Catholic scholar, to show not only that the gifts of the Spirit still exist today, but that they are not optional; they are the necessary tools God has given for both building his Church and spreading the Gospel. With wisdom and practical insight, Clark and Healy walk you through biblical texts, dispel misconceptions, and show that there is an endless variety of gifts. They also show how the gifts are not just for a select few, but distributed freely by the Holy Spirit among believers. After laying this foundation, the authors reveal how you can activate the gifts in your own life and use them to benefit others. In this hurting world, you can give people more than just a message--you can help usher them into an encounter with God.","['Randy Clark', 'Mary Healy']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KXg1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=KXg1DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=The+Spiritual+Gifts+Handbook:+The+Complete+Guide+to+Discovering+and+Using+Your+Spiritual+Gift&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Chosen Books,2018-03-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KXg1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

The Playmaker,"An English lieutenant is ordered to stage a play starring prisoners of the Australian penal colony he supervises in this phantasmagoric historical fiction masterwork from the author of Schindler’s List In the penal colony of Sydney Cove, Australia, at the farthest reaches of the late-nineteenth-century British Empire, Lieutenant Ralph Clark has received a bizarre commission. In honor of the king’s birthday, Clark is charged with staging a production of the George Farquhar comedy The Recruiting Officer using as cast and production crew the highwaymen, whores, cutpurses, killers, and other assorted disreputables exiled there from the British Isles. Pining over the family he left behind, Clark must work miracles with only two printed scripts, a company of unstable and largely illiterate “actors,” and the dubious assistance of his colleagues. But the success—or failure—of the mammoth enterprise rests largely on the shoulders of lead actress Mary Brenham, the mesmerizing and enigmatic female convict to whom Clark finds himself strangely and dangerously attracted. Based on the lieutenant’s real diaries, The Playmaker is a truly remarkable achievement. Atmospheric, dreamlike, and richly evoking time and place, featuring a monumental cast of magnificently drawn, unforgettable characters, it is a work of insight, imagination, and true genius by one of the most notable names in historical fiction.",['Thomas Keneally'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d-PcCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=d-PcCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Playmaker&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2015-12-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d-PcCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],3.0

The Light in the Piazza and Other Italian Tales (Banner Books),"Elizabeth Spencer is captivated by Italy. For her it has been a second home. A one-time resident who returns there, this native-born Mississippian has found Italy to be an enchanting land whose culture lends itself powerfully to her artistic vision. Some of her most acclaimed work is set there. Her American characters encounter but never quite wholly adjust to the mysteries of the Italian mores. Collected here in one volume are Spencer's six Italian tales. Their plots are so alluring and enigmatic that Boccaccio would have been charmed by their delightful ironies and their sinister contrasts of dark and light. Spencer is grounded in two bases—Italy and the American South. Her characters too, mostly southerners, rove in search of connection and fulfillment. In The Light in the Piazza (a novella which has become both Spencer's signature piece and a Hollywood film) a stranger from North Carolina, traveling with her beautiful daughter, encounters the intoxicating beauty of sunlit Florence and discovers a deep conflict in the moral dilemma it presents. “I think this work has great charm,” Spencer has said, “and it probably is the real thing, a work written under great compulsion, while I was under the spell of Italy. But it took me, all told, about a month to write.” In Knights and Dragons (another novella and a companion piece to The Light in the Piazza) an American woman in Rome and Venice struggles for release from her husband's sinister control over her. Spencer sets this tale in the cold and wintry dark and here portrays the other face of Italy. In “The Cousins,” “The Pincian Gate,” “The White Azalea,” and “The Visit,” Spencer shows the exceptional artistry that has merited acclaim for her as one of America's first-class writers of the short story. The Light in the Piazza may long be the work for which she is most recognized. In 2005, the Lincoln Center’s Vivian Beaumont Theater in New York City staged a musical adaptation of this novella. The production brought together the talents of Adam Guettel (music and lyrics) and Craig Lucas (book), while director Bartlett Sher made his Lincoln Center debut. That year the musical won six of the eleven Tony awards it was nominated for. It was thereafter produced on stages across the globe and eventually returned to Lincoln Center in 2016 for a reunion of its original cast as a benefit concert.",['Elizabeth Spencer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rtjKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=rtjKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Light+in+the+Piazza+and+Other+Italian+Tales+(Banner+Books)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Univ.

Enemy Of The State/an,"“In the world of black-op thrillers, Mitch Rapp continues to be among the best of the best” (Booklist, starred review), and he returns in the #1 New York Times bestselling series alone and targeted by a country that is supposed to be one of America’s closest allies. After 9/11, the United States made one of the most secretive and dangerous deals in its history—the evidence against the powerful Saudis who coordinated the attack would be buried and in return, King Faisal would promise to keep the oil flowing and deal with the conspirators in his midst. But when the king’s own nephew is discovered funding ISIS, the furious President gives Rapp his next mission: he must find out more about the high-level Saudis involved in the scheme and kill them. The catch? Rapp will get no support from the United States. Forced to make a decision that will change his life forever, Rapp quits the CIA and assembles a group of independent contractors to help him complete the mission. They’ve barely begun unraveling the connections between the Saudi government and ISIS when the brilliant new head of the intelligence directorate discovers their efforts. With Rapp getting too close, he threatens to go public with the details of the post-9/11 agreement between the two countries. Facing an international incident that could end his political career, the President orders America’s intelligence agencies to join the Saudis’ effort to hunt the former CIA man down. Rapp, supported only by a team of mercenaries with dubious allegiances, finds himself at the center of the most elaborate manhunt in history. With white-knuckled twists and turns leading to “an explosive climax” (Publishers Weekly), Enemy of the State is an unputdownable thrill ride that will keep you guessing until the final page.","['Vince Flynn', 'Kyle Mills']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aZavDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=aZavDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Enemy+Of+The+State/an&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2017-09-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aZavDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],4.0

The Hatfield Photographic Lunar Atlas,"In 2004, it became obvious that Henry Hatfield’s original atlas wasn’t suitable for all current commercially-made amateur telescopes. Newtonian telescopes and astronomical refractors – for many years the only choice for amateurs – invert the observed image. The standard Hatfield Atlas therefore follows the IAU (International Astronomical Union) convention of having maps (and photographs) with South at the top and West on the left: an inverted image. However, the current ranges of Schmidt-Cassegrain and Maksutov telescopes – that’s most of those manufactured by Meade, Celestron, and many others – don’t invert the observed image but instead reverse it left-for-right. That’s with North at the top and East on the left. Because of the way the human visual system works, it is almost impossible to mentally ‘mirror-image’ a map to compare it with the view through the eyepiece , so even turning an IAU-standard atlas upside-down doesn’t help! This new SCT version of the Atlas solves this problem for observers. Identification of lunar features is made quick and easy. The new, digitally re-mastered second edition vastly improves the clarity and definition of the original photographs – significantly beyond the resolution limits of the photographic grains present in earlier atlas versions – whilst preserving the layout and style of the original publications. This has been achieved by merging computer-visualized Earth-based views of the lunar surface, derived from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter data, with scanned copies of Commander Hatfield’s photographic plates, using the author’s own software. The result is a The Hatfield SCT Lunar Atlas for 21st century amateur telescopes up to and beyond 12-inch aperture. It contains all the features that made the original so widely used: a combination of an index of all International Astronomical Union named primary lunar features, and twelve chart areas help to locate any named lunar features of interest that can each be examined under typically five different states of illumination. Close ups of interesting features are also included. The new Atlas is supplemented by an introduction to its use, a short description of the digital re-mastering technique, and a completely new section describing lunar observing techniques. At the end of the atlas there is an index of all named features and crater diameters, along with a summary table of the dates and times that the original Hatfield images represent.",['Anthony Charles Cook'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iMI4nwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=iMI4nwEACAAJ&dq=The+Hatfield+Photographic+Lunar+Atlas&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Springer,2013-10-28,http://books.google.com/books?id=iMI4nwEACAAJ&dq=The+Hatfield+Photographic+Lunar+Atlas&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Science'],

Analysis by Its History (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics / Readings in Mathematics),"This book presents first-year calculus roughly in the order in which it was first discovered. The first two chapters show how the ancient calculations of practical problems led to infinite series, differential and integral calculus and to differential equations. The establishment of mathematical rigour for these subjects in the 19th century for one and several variables is treated in chapters III and IV. Many quotations are included to give the flavor of the history. The text is complemented by a large number of examples, calculations and mathematical pictures and will provide stimulating and enjoyable reading for students, teachers, as well as researchers.","['Ernst Hairer', 'Gerhard Wanner']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kzp4zPIL8B0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Kzp4zPIL8B0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Analysis+by+Its+History+(Undergraduate+Texts+in+Mathematics+/+Readings+in+Mathematics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Springer Science & Business Media,2008-06-02,http://books.google.com/books?id=Kzp4zPIL8B0C&dq=Analysis+by+Its+History+(Undergraduate+Texts+in+Mathematics+/+Readings+in+Mathematics)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Mathematics'],

The Life of Lord Byron,"The great Romantic poet Lord Byron starved himself compulsively for most of his life. His behaviour mystified his friends and other witnesses, yet he never imagined he was ill. Instead, he rationalised his behaviour as a fight for spiritual freedom and made it the cornerstone of his heroic ideal, which was central to his work and to his life and his death. This fresh biographical study aims to explore neglected or misunderstood aspects of his private life to illuminate his writing, his affairs with women, his passion for Napoleon and his conflicted friendships with Coleridge and Shelley. This in turn leads to a new understanding of his masterpiece, Don Juan. 15 July 2019 marks the 200th anniversary of its first publication. Antony Peattie situates these patterns of behaviour in a vividly rendered contemporary world, culminating in Byron’s last days in Greece, where he tried to starve himself into heroic leadership but damaged his constitution, resulting in his death at the age of thirty-six.",['Antony Peattie'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sTmIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=sTmIDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=The+Life+of+Lord+Byron&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Unbound Publishing,2019-09-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sTmIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

"Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder","Isaiah Berlin was deeply admired during his life, but his full contribution was perhaps underestimated because of his preference for the long essay form. The efforts of Henry Hardy to edit Berlin's work and reintroduce it to a broad, eager readership have gone far to remedy this. Now, Princeton is pleased to return to print, under one cover, Berlin's essays on these celebrated and captivating intellectual portraits: Vico, Hamann, and Herder. These essays on three relatively uncelebrated thinkers are not marginal ruminations, but rather among Berlin's most important studies in the history of ideas. They are integral to his central project: the critical recovery of the ideas of the Counter-Enlightenment and the explanation of its appeal and consequences--both positive and (often) tragic. Giambattista Vico was the anachronistic and impoverished Neapolitan philosopher sometimes credited with founding the human sciences. He opposed Enlightenment methods as cold and fallacious. J. G. Hamann was a pious, cranky dilettante in a peripheral German city. But he was brilliant enough to gain the audience of Kant, Goethe, and Moses Mendelssohn. In Hamann's chaotic and long-ignored writings, Berlin finds the first strong attack on Enlightenment rationalism and a wholly original source of the coming swell of romanticism. Johann Gottfried Herder, the progenitor of populism and European nationalism, rejected universalism and rationalism but championed cultural pluralism. Individually, these fascinating intellectual biographies reveal Berlin's own great intelligence, learning, and generosity, as well as the passionate genius of his subjects. Together, they constitute an arresting interpretation of romanticism's precursors. In Hamann's railings and the more considered writings of Vico and Herder, Berlin finds critics of the Enlightenment worthy of our careful attention. But he identifies much that is misguided in their rejection of universal values, rationalism, and science. With his customary emphasis on the frightening power of ideas, Berlin traces much of the next centuries' irrationalism and suffering to the historicism and particularism they advocated. What Berlin has to say about these long-dead thinkers--in appreciation and dissent--is remarkably timely in a day when Enlightenment beliefs are being challenged not just by academics but by politicians and by powerful nationalist and fundamentalist movements. The study of J. G. Hamann was originally published under the title The Magus of the North: J. G. Hamann and the Origins of Modern Irrationalism. The essays on Vico and Herder were originally published as Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas. Both are out of print. This new edition includes a number of previously uncollected pieces on Vico and Herder, two interesting passages excluded from the first edition of the essay on Hamann, and Berlin's thoughtful responses to two reviewers of that same edition.",['Isaiah Berlin'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9GiYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=9GiYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Three+Critics+of+the+Enlightenment:+Vico,+Hamann,+Herder&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Princeton University Press,2013-11-10,"http://books.google.com/books?id=9GiYDwAAQBAJ&dq=Three+Critics+of+the+Enlightenment:+Vico,+Hamann,+Herder&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Philosophy'],

CHAMPAGNE FOR ONE - a Nero Wolfe Mystery,"Faith Usher had a decidedly morbid personality. She talked about taking her life, and kept cyanide in her purse. So when she collapses and dies from a lethal champagne cocktail in the middle of a high society dinner party, everyone calls it suicide—including the police. But Archie was watching it all, and suspects it was murder. So does Nero Wolfe, especially after he's warned by four men against taking the case. For the world's most formidable detective it is a tantalizing puzzle involving an unlikely combination of philanthropy, deception, blackmail, and an unrepentant killer who just may have committed the perfect crime. Introduction by Lena Horne “It is always a treat to read a Nero Wolfe mystery.

The Immortals,"During World War II, on January 29, 1943, the SS Dorchester and a small convoy sailed the perilous route from Newfoundland to the Army Command Base in Greenland. Four chaplains were assigned to the Dorchester with more than 900 men on board. Alexander Goode, a Jewish rabbi; John Washington, a Catholic priest; George Fox, a Methodist minister; and Clark Poling, a Baptist minister, all offered comfort, reassurances, and prayers with a warning from the captain that a German submarine was hunting their convoy. The Nazi U-boat captain, Karl-Jurg Wachter, had been stalking the Americans for days. When bad weather separated the Dorchester from the other convoy ships, Wachter was finally in a position to strike. Just past midnight, on February 3, just hours from their destination, the Dorchester was torpedoed and sank, throwing its passengers into the frigid waters and creating the worst single loss of an American personnel convoy during WWII. Many of the survivors credit the four chaplains with saving their lives. Those chaplains would become known as ""The Immortals"" for their heroism in making the ultimate sacrifice. With no thought of themselves, they calmly helped men to safety through the chaos of their badly damaged ship, searched for spare life jackets for those without--eventually giving away their own life jackets and encouraging men in the freezing waters. The celebrated story of the Immortals is now joined for the first time in print by the largely untold story of another hero of the sinking of the Dorchester: Charles Walter Davis Jr. was a young Black petty officer aboard a Coast Guard cutter traveling with the convoy who bravely dived into the glacial water over and over again, even with hypothermia setting in, to try to rescue the men the chaplains had first helped and inspired to never give up. Thoroughly researched and told in an engrossing non-fiction narrative, the book alternates between accounts told from the perspective of the Nazi U-boat captain and his crew, and the hunted--the men of the American convoy. Using his expertise as an attorney specializing in religious freedom and constitutional law, the author, Steven T. Collis, also paints a thought-provoking portrait of religious life in America during wartime and how American views of faith affected the chaplains and the men they served. Page-turning and inspiring, The Immortals explores the power of faith and religious conviction and powerfully narrates the lives of five heroic men who believed in something greater than themselves, living lives of service and sacrifice for their country and their fellow man.",['Steven T.

Sinister Street (Penguin Modern Classics),"Michael Fane arrives in the thin red house in Carlington Road to his new family of Nurse, Cook, Annie the housemaid, his younger sister Stella, and the occasional presence of Mother. From here, the novel follows the next twenty years of his life as he tries to find his place in the upper echelons of Edwardian society, through prep school, studies at Oxford, and his emergence into the wide world. The setting is rich in period detail, and the characters portrayed are vivid and more nuanced in their actions and stories than first impressions imply. Sinister Street was an immediate critical success on publication, although not without some worry for its openness to discuss less salubrious scenes, and it was a favourite of George Orwell and John Betjeman. Compton Mackenzie had attended both St. James’ school and St. Mary’s College at Oxford and the novel is at least partly autobiographical, but for the same measure was praised as an accurate portrayal of that experience; Max Beerbohm said “There is no book on Oxford like it. It gives you the actual Oxford experience.” Although originally published in two volumes (in 1913 and 1914) for commercial reasons, the two form a single novel and have been brought back together again for this edition.

Sensible Christianity,"Around the globe religion is under attack. Humanists, secularists and atheists depict believers as deluded and dangerous. The aim of this book is to challenge this perception. Sensible Religion defends the validity and emphasises the excitement of the religious quest across the faiths. It demonstrates that the practice of sensible religion is often a courageous path pitted against religious extremism and secularism. Written by committed believers from the major world's faiths, the book endorses the term 'sensible' as expressing religious reasonableness as well as sensitivity to criticism and new insights. Followers of the different traditions live ordinary lives in the mainstream of the world. This volume therefore addresses beliefs and the manner in which these convictions relate to social, political and ethical action. Countering the argument that religion is at root extremist and irrational, Sensible Religion brings together thoughtful and critical reflections by leading thinkers about humanity's spiritual quest.","['Christopher Lewis', 'Dan Cohn-Sherbok']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PbTeCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PbTeCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT111&dq=Sensible+Christianity&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2016-04-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PbTeCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],
On Evolution,"The father of evolution imbibed history with his controversial book On the Origin of Species. As a young scientist studying natural history, Charles Darwin set out on the HMS Beagle for a five-year voyage that would bring him in contact with animal species, plant species, and rock formations all over the world. This voyage established him as an eminent geologist, and his publication of his journal of the voyage established him as a well-known popular author. After continued, careful studying of his findings from his trip around the world, he published one of the most controversial books of history—The Origin of Species—which opposed the church’s theory that all species had come into existence at the time of the Creation. Darwin on Evolution contains quotes and wisdom from The Origin of Species, as well as from his other publications, pertaining to his theories of evolution and natural selection. Readers young and old alike will have the opportunity to learn more about his theories while also taking away important life lessons.

Zachary Scott: Hollywood's Sophisticated Cad (Hollywood Legends Series),"Throughout the 1940s, Zachary Scott (1914–1965) was the model for sophisticated, debonair villains in American film. His best-known roles include a mysterious criminal in The Mask of Dimitrios and the indolent husband in Mildred Pierce. He garnered further acclaim for his portrayal of villains in Her Kind of Man, Danger Signal, and South of St. Louis. Although he earned critical praise for his performance as a heroic tenant farmer in Jean Renoir’s The Southerner, Scott never quite escaped typecasting. In Zachary Scott: Hollywood’s Sophisticated Cad, Ronald L. Davis writes an appealing biography of the film star. Scott grew up in privileged circumstances—his father was a distinguished physician; his grandfather was a pioneer cattle baron—and was expected to follow his father into medical practice. Instead, Scott began to pursue a career in theater while studying at the University of Texas and subsequently worked his way on a ship to England to pursue acting. Upon his return to America, he began to look for work in New York. Excelling on stage and screen throughout the 1940s, Scott seemed destined for stardom. By the end of 1950, however, he had suffered through a turbulent divorce. A rafting accident left him badly shaken and clinically depressed. His frustration over his roles mounted, and he began to drink heavily. He remarried and spent the rest of his career concentrating on stage and television work. Although Scott continued to perform occasionally in films, he never reclaimed the level of stardom that he had in the mid-1940s. To reconstruct Scott’s life, Davis uses interviews with Scott and colleagues and reviews, articles, and archival correspondence from the Scott papers at the University of Texas and from the Warner Bros. Archives. The result is a portrait of a talented actor who was rarely allowed to show his versatility on the screen.",['Ronald L.

Her century-old family dairy farm is falling deeper into debt. Her thirteen-year-old daughter Polly, whom Margaret has tried to shelter from the modern world, is becoming perilously drawn towards her charismatic, subversive history teacher. Her loyal farmhand August, a Thomas Jefferson impersonator by night, is secretly in love with her. And she’s been convinced by the town’s pastor to recreate the original Thomas Jefferson-era, 1,235-pound “Mammoth Cheese,” as a gift for the President elect.

The relevant code provisions (Eurocode and UBC American) are detailed and a number of examples are used to illustrate the principles.

The Shattered Mirror: Representations of Women in Mexican Literature (Texas Pan American Series),"Popular images of women in Mexico—conveyed through literature and, more recently, film and television—were long restricted to either the stereotypically submissive wife and mother or the demonized fallen woman. But new representations of women and their roles in Mexican society have shattered the ideological mirrors that reflected these images. This book explores this major change in the literary representation of women in Mexico. María Elena de Valdés enters into a selective and hard-hitting examination of literary representation in its social context and a contestatory engagement of both the literary text and its place in the social reality of Mexico. Some of the topics she considers are Carlos Fuentes and the subversion of the social codes for women; the poetic ties between Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz and Octavio Paz; questions of female identity in the writings of Rosario Castellanos, Luisa Josefina Hernández, María Luisa Puga, and Elena Poniatowska; the Chicana writing of Sandra Cisneros; and the postmodern celebration—without reprobation—of being a woman in Laura Esquivel's Like Water for Chocolate.",['María Elena de Valdés'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BTMXTzxk2ZYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=BTMXTzxk2ZYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Shattered+Mirror:+Representations+of+Women+in+Mexican+Literature+(Texas+Pan+American+Series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Texas Press,1998,http://books.google.com/books?id=BTMXTzxk2ZYC&dq=The+Shattered+Mirror:+Representations+of+Women+in+Mexican+Literature+(Texas+Pan+American+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

Saddle and Canoe: An Early 19th Century Ride Through the Pacific North-West (Equestrian Travel Classics),"At first glance Theodore Winthrop didn t look like a hardened equestrian adventurer when he set out to travel across Washington Territory in the early 1850s. The twenty-five-year-old was a recent graduate of Yale and a confirmed East Coast intellectual. Winthrop didn t let his education handicap him however. Instead he set out to ride horses and canoes across some of the most remote portions of the early United States. The resultant book, Saddle and Canoe, is a vibrant picture of frontier life in the Pacific Northwest and covers the author s travels along the Straits of Juan De Fuca, on Vancouver Island, across the Naches Pass, and on to The Dalles, in Oregon Territory. Throughout his journey Winthrop spent much of his time among both pioneers and Indians, whose picturesque descriptions are found within the pages of this historic travel account. Never one to hold back his opinions, the Yankee traveler thus regales the reader with personal observations and blunt honesty on a host of topics, people and places. Illustrated with drawings of the period, Saddle and Canoe also contains a vocabulary of the Chinook Indian language which Winthrop used during the course of this historic journey. A treasure to read, the book will be of interest to students of both the horse and history.",['Theodore Winthrop'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pU1ePQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=pU1ePQAACAAJ&dq=Saddle+and+Canoe:+An+Early+19th+Century+Ride+Through+the+Pacific+North-West+(Equestrian+Travel+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Long Riders Guild Press,2001-08-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=pU1ePQAACAAJ&dq=Saddle+and+Canoe:+An+Early+19th+Century+Ride+Through+the+Pacific+North-West+(Equestrian+Travel+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],
Going Straight: An Ex-convict/Psychologist Tells Why and How,"A roadmap from the gutters of society to respectability and success. For those seeking a straight life, it describes what they must change about themselves, and the hazards they must avoid. For anyone interested in crime, punishment, and rehabilitation, it provides an unprecedented look into the minds of offenders. Bluntly acknowledges the existence of unfairness and hypocrisy in society, but not with bitterness or self-pity. Rather it puts these in perspective and shows how the individual offender CAN change and build a respectable life, in spite of the barriers and pitfalls. The author has seen criminal justice and corrections all the way from the cold floor of a solitary cell to the courtroom as an expert witness. Without mincing words and with a touch of humor, he turns this experience to the service of both the offender and society as a whole. (Personal note: Today is November 28, 2010, so GOING STRAIGHT... has been available for almost ten years. I've received numerous letters and emails from readers, telling how they've used it to help themselves and others. Not a single one has told me that he or she considered it a waste of time and money. Whatever your own situation, whether you're in a cell sweating out a parole hearing, or a corrections officer, or teacher, or you care for someone trapped in a criminal lifestyle, or an activist pushing for more rehabilitation-oriented corrections, or interested for any other reason, I sincerely hope you also find this book helpful. My main interest is not the royalties -- they just help offset SOME of the cost of my websites and other rehabilitation efforts. My goal is to know, when it's my time to leave this world, that there are a few people whose lives are better because I was here.

The Military History of World War II 10 Vols,"The 10th was the only US mountain division to be raised in World War II, and still has a high profile, being involved in operations from Iraq to Somalia and from Haiti to Afghanistan. It did not arrive in Europe until winter 1944/45, but then fought hard in the harsh mountainous terrain of Northern Italy. The division was special in a number of ways. Its personnel were selected for physical fitness and experience in winter sports, mountaineering, and hunting, unlike the rest of the infantry. It was highly trained in mountain and winter warfare, including the use of skis and snowshoes, while its organization, field clothing, and some personal equipment also differed from that of the usual infantry division. The division made extensive use of pack-mules, and its reconnaissance unit was horse-mounted, conducting the last horse-mounted charge in US history in April 1945. Featuring full-color artwork and rare photographs, this is the gripping story of the US Army's only mountain division in action during the closing months of World War II.",['Gordon L.

Forty Words for Sorrow (John Cardinal),"A shake of the dark head, a shudder in the shoulders. Another tiny splash on the linoleum floor. Husband murdered, and now her daughter too. The Inuit, it is said, have forty different words for snow. Never mind about snow, Cardinal mused, what people really need is forty words for sorrow. Grief. Heartbreak. Desolation. There were not enough, not for this childless mother in her empty house. [Forty Words for Sorrow, page 42] The mutilated body of a young girl has been discovered in an abandoned mine shaft on the desolate Lake Nipissing island of Windigo. Missing since September, Katie Pine has finally been found, encased in a block of ice as if preserved in amber. The intense police investigation when she first disappeared had gone nowhere, and Detective John Cardinal went from solving murders to investigating burglaries and petty crimes. But now all bets are off. Cardinal is back on the case; this time with a new partner. Lise Delorme, a sexy and passionate former internal investigator, makes Cardinal uneasy. With a guilty conscience to fuel his suspicion, Cardinal wonders if Delorme isn’t there to investigate him. And his suspicions are well founded. Delmore has made a deal with the devil: in order to leave SIU for good, she must gain Cardinal’s trust and then betray it. There are allegations of corruption on the force, and Cardinal’s “extracurricular” activities during a counterfeiting investigation are being called into question. Delorme is convinced that Cardinal is innocent of any wrongdoing and even when her investigation calls his integrity into question, she is reluctant to believe it. When Cardinal makes the gruesome discovery of the bodies of two more missing teenagers, he doesn’t spend time worrying about his suspicions concerning Delorme. His focus is on a more sinister concern–a serial killer hiding somewhere in this quiet northern town. That concern becomes laced with urgency when Karen Steen, a young woman from Guelph, arrives to speak to Cardinal about her missing boyfriend, Keith London. Cardinal begins to believe that Keith is the fourth young person to disappear in Algonquin Bay. But unlike the other victims, he believes that Keith may still be alive. The question now becomes, what is the connection between the three dead and one missing teenager? Can Cardinal and Delorme find Keith London before it’s too late?",['Giles Blunt'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PccgxlVwM1gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PccgxlVwM1gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Forty+Words+for+Sorrow+(John+Cardinal)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Seal Books,2010-04-30,http://books.google.com/books?id=PccgxlVwM1gC&dq=Forty+Words+for+Sorrow+(John+Cardinal)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],28.0

Survive the Night,"THE INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER One of New York Times Book Review's ""summer reads guaranteed to make your heart thump and your skin crawl""; An Amazon Best of the Month Pick; Named a must-read summer book by The Washington Post, USA Today, Vulture, BuzzFeed, Forbes, Entertainment Weekly, CNN, New York Post, Good Housekeeping, E!, PopSugar, CrimeReads, Thrillist, and BookRiot. It’s November 1991. Nirvana's in the tape deck, George H. W. Bush is in the White House, and movie-obsessed college student Charlie Jordan is in a car with a man who might be a serial killer. Josh Baxter, the man behind the wheel, is a virtual stranger to Charlie. They met at the campus ride board, each looking to share the long drive home to Ohio. Both have good reasons for wanting to get away. For Charlie, it’s guilt and grief over the shocking murder of her best friend, who became the third victim of the man known as the Campus Killer. For Josh, it’s to help care for his sick father—or so he says. The longer she sits in the passenger seat, the more Charlie notices there’s something suspicious about Josh, from the holes in his story about his father to how he doesn’t want her to see inside the trunk. As they travel an empty, twisty highway in the dead of night, an increasingly anxious Charlie begins to think she’s sharing a car with the Campus Killer. Is Josh truly dangerous? Or is Charlie’s jittery mistrust merely a figment of her movie-fueled imagination? One thing is certain—Charlie has nowhere to run and no way to call for help. Trapped in a terrifying game of cat and mouse played out on pitch-black roads and in neon-lit parking lots, Charlie knows the only way to win is to survive the night.",['Riley Sager'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mvtvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mvtvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Survive+the+Night&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2022-08-30,http://books.google.com/books?id=mvtvEAAAQBAJ&dq=Survive+the+Night&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],16.0

In Her Hands: Craftswomen Changing the World: A Book of Postcards (Postcard Books),"The Millennium Dome, Braveheart and Rolls Royce cars. How do cultural icons reproduce and transform a sense of national identity? How does national identity vary across time and space, how is it contested, and what has been the impact of globalization upon national identity and culture?This book examines how national identity is represented, performed, spatialized and materialized through popular culture and in everyday life. National identity is revealed to be inherent in the things we often take for granted - from landscapes and eating habits, to tourism, cinema and music. Our specific experience of car ownership and motoring can enhance a sense of belonging, whilst Hollywood blockbusters and national exhibitions provide contexts for the ongoing, and often contested, process of national identity formation. These and a wealth of other cultural forms and practices are explored, with examples drawn from Scotland, the UK as a whole, India and Mauritius. This book addresses the considerable neglect of popular cultures in recent studies of nationalism and contributes to debates on the relationship between ‘high' and ‘low' culture.",['Tim Edensor'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UsXrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UsXrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=In+Her+Hands:+Craftswomen+Changing+the+World:+A+Book+of+Postcards+(Postcard+Books)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2020-06-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UsXrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],

The Politics of Child Abuse,"Child abuse policy in the United States contains dangerous contradictions, which have only intensified as the public slowly accepted it as a middle class problem. One contradiction is the rapidly expanding child abuse industry (made up of enterprising psychotherapists and attorneys) which is consuming enormous resources, while thousands of poor children are seriously injured or killed, many while being ""protected"" by public agencies. This ""rediscovery"" has also led to the frenzied pursuit of offenders, resulting in the sacrifice of some innocent people. Moreover, the media's focus on the sensational details of high-visibility sexual abuse cases has helped to trivialize, if not commercialize, the child abuse problem. As such, child abuse has gone from a social problem to a social spectacle. By the 1980s the child welfare system had become a virtual ""nonsystem,"" marked by a staggering turnover of staff, unmanageable caseloads, a severe shortage of funding, and caseloads composed of highly dysfunctional families (many with drug-related problems). To make room for these families, public agencies rationed services by increasingly screening-out child abuse reports which contained little likelihood of serious bodily harm. In The Politics of Child Abuse in America, the authors argue that child abuse must be viewed as a public safety problem. This redefinition would make it congruent with other family-based social trends, including the crackdown on domestic violence. Children must have the same legal protection currently extended to physically and sexually abused women. This can be done by creating a ""Children's Authority,"" which would have the overall charge for protecting children. Specifically, Children's Authorities would have the responsibility for providing the six main functions of child protection: investigation, enforcement, placement services, prevention and education, family support, and research and development. Offering a unique perspective on the cold reality of this crisis, The Politics of Child Abuse in America will be a provocative work for social workers and human service personnel, as well as the general reader concerned with this timely issue.","['Lela B.

Moral Courage,"Why did a group of teenagers watch a friend die instead of putting their own reputations at risk? Why did a top White House official decide to come clean and accept a prison sentence during Watergate? Why did a finance executive turn down millions out of respect for her employer? Why are some willing to risk their futures to uphold principles? What gives us the strength to stand up for what we believe? As these questions suggest, the topic of moral courage is front and center in today's culture. Enron, Arthur Andersen, the U.S. Olympic Committee, abusive priests, cheating students, domestic violence -- all these remind us that taking ethical stands should be a higher priority in our culture. Why, when people discern wrongdoing, are they sometimes unready, unable, or unwilling to act? In a book rich with examples, Rushworth Kidder reveals that moral courage is the bridge between talking ethics and doing ethics. Defining it as a readiness to endure danger for the sake of principle, he explains that the courage to act is found at the intersection of three elements: action based on core values, awareness of the risks, and a willingness to endure necessary hardship. By exploring how moral courage spurs us to strive for core values, he demonstrates the benefits of ethical action to the individual and to society -- and the severe consequences that can result from remaining morally dormant. Moral Courage puts indispensable concepts and tools into our hands, equipping us to respond to the increasingly complicated moral challenges we face at work, at home, and in our communities. It enables us to make clear, confident decisions by exploring some litmus-test questions: Is the benefit worth the risk? Am I motivated by my desire to uphold my beliefs or just to impose them on others? Will my actions create collateral damage among those with no stake in the outcome? While physical courage may no longer be a necessary survival skill or an essential rite of passage out of childhood, few would dispute the growing need for moral courage as the true gauge of maturity. Treating this subject not as an esoteric branch of philosophy but as a practical necessity for modern life, Kidder deftly leads us to a clear understanding of what moral courage is, what it does, and how to get it.",['Rushworth M.

Nothing Succeeds than Success: An Approach to Inspiration and Success,"Do you feel underutilized in your profession? Do you want a success that of your childhood hero? Do you want to lead people in your social or spiritual motive? Superficially, Nothing Succeeds than Success revolves around these questions. However, rather than answering them and giving an evergreen formula of success, it simply says: ""You decide"". It goes one step ahead by provoking the introspection nerve of the reader. It emphasizes on personalizing one's success in order to gain a psychologically authoritative control over it. It does so, as the quest for success does not start with you. It starts with I the I for Introspection: Why do I want to succeed? How do I define success? Whom do I consider to be inspirational? How do I look at his stuff? The urge for an evergreen success formula makes us think of successful people's success and define our own. In this never ending quest for success, the book categorizes successful people whose kind of success we dream to imitate. With each category of successful people, it makes us talk to our various states of mind to put it into plain words: our most obvious rational and emotional responses when we think of a given success and the achiever. At every conclusive stage, it suggests an ideal approach of mind. No, it does not relate it to the end result that we identify plainly as success or failure.

Mandated Landscape: British Imperial Rule in Palestine 1929-1948,"In this ground-breaking authoritative study, a highly documented and incisive analysis is made of the galvanising changes wrought to the people and landscape of British Mandated Palestine (1929-1948). Using a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach, the book’s award-winning author examines how the British imposed their rule, dominated by the clashing dualities of their Mandate obligations towards the Arabs and the Jews, and their own interests. The rulers’ Empire-wide conceptions of the ‘White man’s burden’ and preconceptions of the Holy Land were potent forces of change, influencing their policies. Lucidly written, Mandated Landscape is also a rich source of information supported by numerous maps, tables and illustrations, and has 66 appendices, a considerable bibliography and extensive index. With a theoretical and historical backdrop, the ramifications of British rule are highlighted in their impact on town planning, agriculture, forestry, land, the partition plans and a case study, presenting discussions on such issues as development, ecological shock, law and the controversial division of village lands, as the British operated in a politically turbulent climate, often within their own administration. This book is a major contribution to research on British Palestine and will interest those in Middle East, history, geography, development and colonial/postcolonial studies.",['Roza El-Eini'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wpSRAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=wpSRAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mandated+Landscape:+British+Imperial+Rule+in+Palestine+1929-1948&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2004-11-23,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wpSRAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],

The Appalachian Trail,"The Appalachian Trail is America's most beloved trek, with millions of hikers setting foot on it every year. Yet few are aware of the fascinating backstory of the dreamers and builders who helped bring it to life over the past century. The conception and building of the Appalachian Trail is a story of unforgettable characters who explored it, defined it, and captured national attention by hiking it. From Grandma Gatewood--a mother of eleven who thru-hiked in canvas sneakers and a drawstring duffle--to Bill Bryson, author of the best-selling A Walk in the Woods, the AT has seized the American imagination like no other hiking path. The 2,000-mile-long hike from Georgia to Maine is not just a trail through the woods, but a set of ideas about nature etched in the forest floor. This character-driven biography of the trail is a must-read not just for ambitious hikers, but for anyone who wonders about our relationship with the great outdoors and dreams of getting away from urban life for a pilgrimage in the wild.","[""Philip D'Anieri""]",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fCTrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fCTrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Appalachian+Trail&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Mariner Books,2021,http://books.google.com/books?id=fCTrDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Appalachian+Trail&hl=&source=gbs_api,['HISTORY'],1.0
"The Church: Our Story: Catholic Tradtion, Mission, and Practice","Written in accord with the Catechism of the Catholic Church and rooted in the sound catechetical principles of the National Catechetical Directory, these texts present a well-defined curriculum model that stresses clear objectives, careful organization, and creative methods and evaluation procedures to check the attainment of goals. Very flexible, allowing teachers to select materials to highlight and stress, each text can be implemented on various grade levels for a quarter, a semester, or a full year depending on the length and frequency of class meetings. Intended to function as the primary textbook for a semester or year-long course in a Catholic high school at the eleventh and twelfth grade levels the goal of the course is to help students understand the interrelationship of the components of the Catholic Church. This course emphasizes the living Church and what it is in the present moment and is constructed around themes such as the Church as the People of God, the Church as servant, and the Church as sacrament. Each theme traces major periods of Church history and provides insights as to how the Church has come to its contemporary expression. Recognizing that to truly understand what it means to be Catholic, one must look not only at current theology, worship, and belief, but how those things were developed and accepted through history, The Church: Our Story combines a discussion of ecclesiology -- literally the ""study of the nature of the Church"" -- with a discussion of Church history. The purpose of the historical sections are not to recount all of the significant events over the past two thousand years, but rather to give insight into the beliefs, practices, and tensionsin Catholicism today that resulted from their historical roots.",['Patricia Morrison Driedger'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o6vMlv_mCUkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=o6vMlv_mCUkC&q=The+Church:+Our+Story:+Catholic+Tradtion,+Mission,+and+Practice&dq=The+Church:+Our+Story:+Catholic+Tradtion,+Mission,+and+Practice&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",,1999,"http://books.google.com/books?id=o6vMlv_mCUkC&dq=The+Church:+Our+Story:+Catholic+Tradtion,+Mission,+and+Practice&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Religion'],

The Master Sniper,"In the death throes of World War II, one man is still at war, and he’s got got the world’s deadliest weapon in his hands . . . With a sniper’s rifle he has calmly executed hundreds of enemy soldiers in a single battle, and gunned down thousands of innocent civilians in a single day, waiting patiently for the barrel of his gun to cool before resuming his craft . . . It is the spring of 1945. And Repp, the master sniper, is about to carry out his final mission—even as Germay’s enemies overrun it, even while a tired, disorganized team of American and British agents tries everything in its power to stop him. Because for Repp, this is the one job at which he cannot fail. For this time, he possesses the ultimate killing tool. And with it, he will commit the ultimate crime. . . .

The Big Sleep (BFI Film Classics),"The Big Sleep: Marlowe and Vivian practising kissing; General Sternwood shivering in a hothouse full of orchids; a screenplay, co-written by Faulkner, famously mysterious and difficult to solve. Released in 1946, Howard Hawks' adaptation of Raymond Chandler reunited Bogart and Bacall and gave them two of their most famous roles. The mercurial but ever-manipulative Hawks dredged humour and happiness out of film noir. 'Give him a story about more murders than anyone can keep up with, or explain,' David Thomson writes in his compelling study of the film, 'and somehow he made a paradise.' When it was first shown to a military audience The Big Sleep was coldly received. So, as Thomson reveals, Hawks shot extra scenes, 'fun' scenes, to replace one in which the film's murders had been explained, and in so doing left the plot unresolved. Thomson argues that, if this was accidental, it also signalled a change in the nature of Hollywood cinema: 'The Big Sleep inaugurates a post-modern, camp, satirical view of movies being about other movies that extends to the New Wave and Pulp Fiction.'",['David Thomson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pu7_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=pu7_DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Big+Sleep+(BFI+Film+Classics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,British Film Institute,2020-11-12,http://books.google.com/books?id=pu7_DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Big+Sleep+(BFI+Film+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Performing Arts'],

Anthem,"The first big novel of 2022: an epic literary thriller set where America is right now, in which a band of unlikely heroes sets out on a quest to save one innocent life--and might end up saving us all. The wheels are coming off in America. Opioid addictions accelerate unstoppably. Environmental collapse can be read in every weather report. Vigilante bands take over streets at night, wearing clownface makeup. The very idea of government, of citizenship, is challenged daily. And something is happening to teenagers across the country, spreading through memes only they know. At the Float Anxiety Abatement Center, in a suburb of Chicago, Simon Oliver is trying to recover from his sister's tragic passing. He breaks out to join a woman named Louise and a man called The Prophet on a quest as urgent as it is enigmatic. Who lies at the end of the road? A man known as The Wizard, whose past encounter with Louise sparked her own collapse. Their quest becomes a rescue mission when they join up with a man whose sister is being held captive by the Wizard, impregnated and imprisoned in a tower. Noah Hawley's new novel is a freewheeling adventure that finds unquenchable lights in dark corners. Unforgettably vivid characters and a plot as fast and bright as pop cinema blend in a Vonnegutian story that is as timeless as a Grimm's fairy tale. It is a leap into the idiosyncratic pulse of the American heart, written with the bravado, literary power, and feverish foresight that have made Hawley one of our most essential writers.",['Noah Hawley'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ln1uzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ln1uzgEACAAJ&dq=Anthem&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2022-01-18,http://books.google.com/books?id=ln1uzgEACAAJ&dq=Anthem&hl=&source=gbs_api,,

"Vietnam, Lotus in a Sea of Fire: A Buddhist Proposal for Peace.","This stunning commentary on the cultural and political background to the war in Vietnam resonates deeply as the first work of Vietnamese writer, peace activist, and Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh This rare book from 1967 is one of the very few written in English giving a Vietnamese perspective on the Indochina Wars. Many years ahead of its time, Vietnam: Lotus in a Sea of Fire will be welcomed by historians and readers of contemporary Vietnamese narratives. As war raged in Vietnam, the Zen monk Thich Nhat Hanh became a leading figure in the Buddhist peace movement. With the help of friends like Catholic monk Thomas Merton, he published Vietnam: Lotus in a Sea of Fire in 1967 in the US (and underground in Vietnam as Hoa Sen Trong Biển Lửa), his uncompromising and radical call for peace. It gave voice to the majority of Vietnamese people who did not take sides and who wanted the bombing to stop. Thomas Merton wrote the foreword, believing it had the power to show Americans that the more America continued to bomb Vietnam, the more communists it would create. This was Thich Nhat Hanh's first book in English and made waves in the growing anti-war movement in the United States at the time. Thich Nhat Hanh's portrayal of the plight of the Vietnamese people during the Indochina Wars is required reading now as the United States and Europe continue to grapple with their roles as global powers—and the human effects of their military policies. Vietnam: Lotus in a Sea of Fire is of special interest for students of peace and conflict studies and Southeast Asian history. It also gives the reader insights into the thought of the young Thich Nhat Hanh, who would later go on to found--in exile--Plum Village in France, the largest Buddhist monastery outside Asia, and influence millions with his teachings on the path of peace and mindfulness.",['Thich Nhat Hanh'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nnwQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=nnwQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Vietnam,+Lotus+in+a+Sea+of+Fire:+A+Buddhist+Proposal+for+Peace.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Parallax Press,2022-08-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nnwQEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],

EXCHANGE RATE MODELLING,"Are foreign exchange markets efficient? Are fundamentals important for predicting exchange rate movements? What is the signal-to-ratio of high frequency exchange rate changes? Is it possible to define a measure of the equilibrium exchange rate that is useful from an assessment perspective? The book is a selective survey of current thinking on key topics in exchange rate economics, supplemented throughout by new empirical evidence. The focus is on the use of advanced econometric tools to find answers to these and other questions which are important to practitioners, policy-makers and academic economists. In addition, the book addresses more technical econometric considerations such as the importance of the choice between single-equation and system-wide approaches to modelling the exchange rate, and the reduced form versus structural equation problems. Readers will gain both a comprehensive overview of the way macroeconomists approach exchange rate modelling, and an understanding of how advanced techniques can help them explain and predict the behavior of this crucial economic variable.","['Ronald MacDonald', 'Ian Marsh']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KmPaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=KmPaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=EXCHANGE+RATE+MODELLING&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-04-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KmPaBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],

The Old Man,"From the New York Times–bestselling author of Poison Flower: a retired intelligence officer is caught in “[a] harrowing hunt-and-hide adventure” (The New York Times). To all appearances, Dan Chase is a harmless retiree in Vermont with two big mutts and a grown daughter he keeps in touch with by phone. But most sixty-year-old widowers don’t have multiple driver’s licenses, savings stockpiled in banks across the country, or two Beretta Nanos stashed in the spare bedroom closet. Most have not spent decades on the run. Thirty-five years ago, as a young army intelligence hotshot, Chase was sent to Libya to covertly assist a rebel army. When the plan turned sour, Chase acted according to his conscience—and triggered consequences he never could have anticipated. To this day, someone still wants him dead. And just when he thought he was finally safe, Chase is confronted with the history he spent much of his life trying to escape. “Perry drives deep into Jack Reacher territory in this stand-alone [novel] . . .

The Weathermakers,"The #1 international bestseller on climate change that’s been endorsed by policy makers, scientists, writers and energy executives around the world. Tim Flannery’s The Weather Makers contributed in bringing the topic of global warming to worldwide prominence. For the first time, a scientist provided an accessible and comprehensive account of the history, current status, and future impact of climate change, writing what has been acclaimed by reviewers everywhere as the definitive book on global warming. With one out of every five living things on this planet committed to extinction by the levels of greenhouse gases that will accumulate in the next few decades, we are reaching a global climatic tipping point. The Weather Makers is both an urgent warning and a call to arms, outlining the history of climate change, how it will unfold over the next century, and what we can do to prevent a cataclysmic future. Originally somewhat of a global warming skeptic, Tim Flannery spent several years researching the topic and offers a connect-the-dots approach for a reading public who has received patchy or misleading information on the subject. Pulling on his expertise as a scientist to discuss climate change from a historical perspective, Flannery also explains how climate change is interconnected across the planet.

"The Robin & the Kestrel (Bardic Voices, Book 2)","Acclaimed naturalist and birdwatcher Stephen Moss brings us this year's perfect Christmas gift: a year in the life of Britain's favourite bird - the robin. In The Robin Moss records a year of observing the robin both close to home and in the field to shed light on the hidden life of this apparently familiar bird. We follow its lifecycle from the time it enters the world as an egg, through its time as a nestling and juvenile, to the adult bird; via courtship, song, breeding, feeding, migration - and ultimately, death. At the same time, we trace the robin's relationship with us: how did this bird - one of more than 300 species in its huge and diverse family - find its way so deeply and permanently into our nation's heart and its social and cultural history? It's a story that tells us as much about ourselves as it does about the robin itself. No other bird is quite so ever-present and familiar, so embedded in our culture, as the robin. But how much do we really know about this bird?

Forbidden Surrender,"A Romance Novel by USA Today Bestselling Author Priscilla West Note: This is the beginning of Vincent & Kristen's story. You DO NOT need to read any books in the Forever Series before enjoying this one. ""What gives you a thrill Kristen?"" The minute I saw Vincent Sorenson, I knew he was trouble. Arrogant. Controlling. Possessive. He was everything I craved, and nothing I needed. Unfortunately, I couldn't just avoid him. The higher ups at my company decided they needed his business, and I was on the team to bring him in. Vincent Sorenson didn't seem as interested in business as he was in me, but I knew that was a door better left unopened. If I got involved with him, it would only unearth the pain I spent years trying to bury. I thought I had it under control, but I seriously underestimated Vincent's seductive charm and silver-tongue. I would soon find out how delicious it would feel to let myself fall into this forbidden surrender. ___________________ Reading Order: The Forever series currently follows three different couples.

Feminine Face of God,"“An honest, compelling, surprising, and vastly reassuring book about the spiritual life of women . . . This landmark book is spiritual precisely because it is authentic.”—Joan Borysenko, Ph.D., author of Minding the Body, Mending the Mind With a foreword by Jean Shinoda Bolen, M.D. For many contemporary women, the old patriarchal models of religion are no longer relevant, forming a need to look beyond the male-oriented past to a wider, more fulfilling spiritual horizon. In this fascinating and thought-provoking book, Sherry Anderson and Patricia Hopkins show how many women have redefined traditional beliefs and rediscovered their own unique spiritual heritage—The Feminine Face of God. Anderson and Hopkins guide you through the sacred garden of: • Childhood—seedbed of life's sacred passage • Leaving home—finding your own inner authority • Relationships—new perspectives on intimacy • Spiritual practice—the importance of guidance and discipline • Sexuality—a wild card constantly cracking open the heart • And much more As women enter their sacred garden and learn the art of inner listening, they acquire the tools for living, loving, and praying authentically. In The Feminine Face of God there are seeds for growth: for creating and sustaining intimacy and love in a new way; for a new understanding of sexuality; for a new vision of family, a family of choice in a community of love.",['Sherry Ruth Anderson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iawMikE5cm8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=iawMikE5cm8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Feminine+Face+of+God&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bantam,2010-07-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iawMikE5cm8C&source=gbs_api,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",

Memoirs of the Warrior Kumagai,"“A tour de force combining a commanding mastery of historical fact and detail, a comprehensive understanding of the human spirit, and a poetic quality of expression that transforms the hearts of all those it touches.” —The Japan Foundation Newsletter Kumagai Naozane was a Japanese warrior famous for having taken the head of the young and handsome samurai Atsumori. This episode has become one of the best-known and best-loved stories in the Japanese historical classic, The Heiké Story (Heike Monogatari). This book is a fictionalized version of Kumagai’s own attempt to come to terms with his past—that real past which is his and that other past which he hears the monks inventing as they compose the text which will eventually become The Heiké Story. As the warrior remembers his past and compares it to its fictional parallel, he evokes the wonders of the city of Heiankyo (Kyoto); the wars which raised the Taira (Heike) clan to power and later reduced it to ruin at the hands of the Genji clan; the battles at the Uji River; life in the imperial court of the retired emperor Go-Shirakawa; and the celebrated final Taira battle—the naval encounter at Dannoura, where the infant emperor Antoku was delivered to the depths of the sea.

The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1),"A gripping and prescient tale from New York Times best selling author Joel C. Rosenberg. ""... The Last Jihad absolutely crackles with high energy and a chilling premise--what if the war on terror goes nuclear."" -- Rush Limbaugh Jon Bennett is a top Wall Street strategist turned senior White House advisor. But nothing has prepared him for the terror that he will face. Saddam Hussein dispatches his top hit men to assassinate the President of the United States. Iraqi terrorists spread carnage throughout London, Paris, and Riyadh . . . and the Butcher of Baghdad has a nuclear ace in his hand that he has not yet played. Only a solid Arab-Isreali coalition against Iraq can keep the U.S.--and other Western nations--from certain devastation. And only Bennett and his beautiful partner, Erin McCoy, can make that happen. Their secret project--a billion-dollar oil deal off the coast of Gaza--could be the basis for an historic peace treaty and enormous wealth for every Isreali and Palestinian. But just before a treaty can be signed, Isreali commandos foil an Iraqi Scud missile launch, recovering a nuclear warhead and evidence that the next attack will level Washington, New York and Tel Aviv. Now, the Isreali Prime Minister gives the American President an ultimatum: Melt down Baghdad within one hour . . . or Israel will do it herself. From Jerusalem, Bennett and McCoy must summon all their stealth and savvy to save themselves--and the world--from absolute destruction.

Grand View,"The ""Lutheran"" in the title doesn't mean The Lutheran Toolkit is just for Lutherans. It's about a Lutheran witness for the whole church and for all sinners with ears to hear. It's a slender book about the big theological ideas the evangelical reformers of the 16th century used as a lens for understanding God's work in Christ. Starting with Philip Melanchthon's 1530 Augsburg Confession, which was drafted to defend the preaching and teaching of Luther and his colleagues, Ken Sundet Jones sees its primary themes as a set of tools that God uses to build faith in us. He takes the reader beyond scholarly analysis and historical explanations and uses his own experience as a college professor, parish pastor, and sinner looking for mercy, to discover God's handiwork in our lives. Each chapter takes as its starting point one of the foundational ideas presented to the Holy Roman Emperor and representatives of the church, including Sin, God hidden and revealed, justification, ministry, the Christian life, the church, sacraments, and vocation. These are not simply theological categories for scholars to debate or historians to recount. They're the lived experience of the faithful from the first believers, to big thinkers like Augustine and Luther, to people in the pews, at the supper table, in their careers, and at their deathbeds throughout the ages. The tools in this kit continually point to Jesus as the one who promises mercy and abundant life - and who has the power to deliver them. This is a word for those who've not yet heard it and for those who desperately need to hear it again.",['Ken Sundet Jones'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vruxzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=vruxzQEACAAJ&dq=Grand+View&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,1517 Publishing,2021-02-09,http://books.google.com/books?id=vruxzQEACAAJ&dq=Grand+View&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

The New History of Florida,"The New History of Florida, the first comprehensive history of the state to be written in a quarter of a century, is the culmination of the most recent and significant work from a galaxy of specialists. Each of the 22 chapters, which weave together in one continuous narrative, was written especially for this volume. Their authors present here not only political, economic, military, and religious information but also social history and personal experiences. Endnotes and a bibliography are appended to each chapter. Florida's first inhabitants entered the peninsula and panhandle about 10,000 years ago. The Spaniard Juan Ponce de León stumbled ashore near Melbourne Beach in 1513. He called the place La Florida, the first permanent geographic name of European origin to be etched upon the maps of the American continent. Over three centuries of Spanish and English colonial history followed before the United States acquired Florida in 1821. The first state flag was raised over a new capitol in Tallahassee on May 26, 1845. Written to observe the sesquicentennial of statehood, this work will document the rich history of the Sunshine State for general readers, students, and scholars well into the twenty-first century.

World Class Teams: Working Across Borders,"From a leading authority in the field, a groundbreaking look at harnessing the power of cross-functional global teams ""World Class Teams is an invaluable resource for any company executive looking to break through functional and cultural walls to compete effectively in the global marketplace."" -Vic Micati, Executive Vice President, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Group ""As a global company, we know what it takes to compete in the international marketplace. This book offers valuable answers and practical strategies for doing just that. World Class Teams is in a class by itself."" -Cathie Black, President, Hearst Magazines ""A well-focused book with immediate practical application for global businesses. The toolkits will help avoid reinventing best practice and enable teams to get off to a running start. Everyone is setting up teams but hardly anyone is setting them up well-this book will help you do that."" -Andy Owen-Jones, General Manager, Information Services, Virgin Atlantic ""While there are many books written about 'teams,' World Class Teams is the best book I have read recently. It provides practical insights for creating and leading teams that are highly diverse and, perhaps, geographically dispersed. A must read!""- Julie O'Mara, O'Mara Past President, American Society for Training and Development ""Terrific! World Class Teams is user friendly, practical, experience-based and comprehensive . . . [it is] a veritable toolkit for both team leaders and consultants."" -Donna McNamara, Director, Global Education & Training, Colgate-Palmolive Company To compete successfully in today's global marketplace, companies have to be lean, flexible, and responsive to their customers. They must also be creative, quick, and customized so they can adapt to new market opportunities. To achieve this, more and more organizations are rejecting their hierarchical, functionally driven pyramid structures in favor of a flatter, team-based approach that brings together individuals from diverse backgrounds and specializations who can pool their expertise. As many in the business arena are realizing, the concept of teamwork is quickly becoming a key global competitive strategy for developing and delivering innovative products and services in a faster, more efficient manner. In World Class Teams, Lynda McDermott and her coauthors draw heavily from their experience with such international firms as Pfizer, Colgate, AT&T, Coopers & Lybrand, and Motorola to give managers, executive training organizations, team leaders, and HR and OD specialists a hands-on guide that will help them develop, launch, lead, and evaluate world class teams. An ASTD award winner for her work in the field, McDermott addresses the major issues surrounding the creation and management of cross-functional global teams. Although organizations are rushing to form teams, few invest the time and resources necessary to help lay the groundwork for productive cross-functional/cross-cultural team success. Offering real-world answers and practical strategies, this broad-based fieldbook provides specific guidelines on how teams can become ""world class"" performers. Each topically organized chapter answers a wide range of key issues, including: * Selecting and developing world class team leaders * Methods for measuring and rewarding performance * Team-based goal setting * Leveraging today's technology for maximum team performance * Managing the functional and cultural borders of world class teams Written in accessible terms, World Class Teams can help anybody involved with team building manage such essentials as internal team processes, competition among teams for resources and recognition, individuals who don't want to function as interdependent team members, and compensation systems that reward teams as opposed to solo performances. Packed with individual and team exercises, as well as useful toolkits filled with techniques, models, and sample documents, this is must reading for anyone looking to build and maintain a strong world class team.","['Lynda C.

Heinz Kohut: The Making of a Psychoanalyst,"Heinz Kohut (1913-1981) stood at the center of the twentieth-century psychoanalytic movement. After fleeing his native Vienna when the Nazis took power, he arrived in Chicago, where he spent the rest of his life. He became the most creative figure in the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis, and is now remembered as the founder of 'self psychology,' whose emphasis on empathy sought to make Freudian psychoanalysis less neutral. Kohut's life invited complexity. He obfuscated his identity as a Jew, negotiated a protean sexuality, and could be surprisingly secretive about his health and other matters. In this biography, Charles Strozier shows Kohut as a paradigmatic figure in American intellectual life: a charismatic man whose ideas embodied the hope and confusions of a country still in turmoil. Inherent in his life and formulated in his work were the core issues of modern America. The years after World War II were the halcyon days of American psychoanalysis, which thrived as one analyst after another expanded upon Freud's insights. The gradual erosion of the discipline's humanism, however, began to trouble clinicians and patients alike. Heinz Kohut took the lead in the creation of the first authentically home-grown psychoanalytic movement. It took an emigre be so distinctly American. Strozier brings to his telling of Kohut's life all the tools of a skillful analyst: intelligence, erudition, empathy, contrary insight, and a willingness to look far below the surface.",['Charles Strozier'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YNH0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=YNH0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Heinz+Kohut:+The+Making+of+a+Psychoanalyst&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Other Press, LLC",2020-10-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YNH0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],

Midnight Cowboy,"""Much more than a page-turner. It’s the first essential work of cultural history of the new decade."" —Charles Kaiser, The Guardian One of The Washington Post's 50 best nonfiction books of 2021 | A Publishers Weekly best book of 2021 The Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist and New York Times–bestselling author of the behind-the-scenes explorations of the classic American Westerns High Noon and The Searchers now reveals the history of the controversial 1969 Oscar-winning film that signaled a dramatic shift in American popular culture. Director John Schlesinger’s Darling was nominated for five Academy Awards, and introduced the world to the transcendently talented Julie Christie. Suddenly the toast of Hollywood, Schlesinger used his newfound clout to film an expensive, Panavision adaptation of Far from the Madding Crowd. Expectations were huge, making the movie’s complete critical and commercial failure even more devastating, and Schlesinger suddenly found himself persona non grata in the Hollywood circles he had hoped to conquer. Given his recent travails, Schlesinger’s next project seemed doubly daring, bordering on foolish. James Leo Herlihy’s novel Midnight Cowboy, about a Texas hustler trying to survive on the mean streets of 1960’s New York, was dark and transgressive. Perhaps something about the book’s unsparing portrait of cultural alienation resonated with him. His decision to film it began one of the unlikelier convergences in cinematic history, centered around a city that seemed, at first glance, as unwelcoming as Herlihy’s novel itself. Glenn Frankel’s Shooting Midnight Cowboy tells the story of a modern classic that, by all accounts, should never have become one in the first place. The film’s boundary-pushing subject matter—homosexuality, prostitution, sexual assault—earned it an X rating when it first appeared in cinemas in 1969. For Midnight Cowboy, Schlesinger—who had never made a film in the United States—enlisted Jerome Hellman, a producer coming off his own recent flop and smarting from a failed marriage, and Waldo Salt, a formerly blacklisted screenwriter with a tortured past. The decision to shoot on location in New York, at a time when the city was approaching its gritty nadir, backfired when a sanitation strike filled Manhattan with garbage fires and fears of dysentery. Much more than a history of Schlesinger’s film, Shooting Midnight Cowboy is an arresting glimpse into the world from which it emerged: a troubled city that nurtured the talents and ambitions of the pioneering Polish cinematographer Adam Holender and legendary casting director Marion Dougherty, who discovered both Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight and supported them for the roles of “Ratso” Rizzo and Joe Buck—leading to one of the most intensely moving joint performances ever to appear on screen. We follow Herlihy himself as he moves from the experimental confines of Black Mountain College to the theatres of Broadway, influenced by close relationships with Tennessee Williams and Anaïs Nin, and yet unable to find lasting literary success. By turns madcap and serious, and enriched by interviews with Hoffman, Voight, and others, Shooting Midnight Cowboy: Art, Sex, Loneliness, Liberation, and the Making of a Dark Classic is not only the definitive account of the film that unleashed a new wave of innovation in American cinema, but also the story of a country—and an industry—beginning to break free from decades of cultural and sexual repression.",['Glenn Frankel'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5bniDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5bniDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Midnight+Cowboy&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2021-03-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5bniDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Performing Arts'],1.0

Stochastic Integrals (Probability and Mathematical Statistics: A Series of Monographs and Textbooks 5),"Stochastic Integrals discusses one area of diffusion processes: the differential and integral calculus based upon the Brownian motion. The book reviews Gaussian families, construction of the Brownian motion, the simplest properties of the Brownian motion, Martingale inequality, and the law of the iterated logarithm. It also discusses the definition of the stochastic integral by Wiener and by Ito, the simplest properties of the stochastic integral according to Ito, and the solution of the simplest stochastic differential equation. The book explains diffusion, Lamperti's method, forward equation, Feller's test for the explosions, Cameron-Martin's formula, the Brownian local time, and the solution of dx=e(x) db + f(x) dt for coefficients with bounded slope. It also tackles Weyl's lemma, diffusions on a manifold, Hasminski's test for explosions, covering Brownian motions, Brownian motions on a Lie group, and Brownian motion of symmetric matrices. The book gives as example of a diffusion on a manifold with boundary the Brownian motion with oblique reflection on the closed unit disk of R squared.

Spanish Music in the Twentieth Century,"From the exhilarating impact of Isaac Albeniz at the beginning of the century to today's complex and adventurous avant-garde, this complete interpretive history introduces twentieth-century Spanish music to English-speaking readers. With graceful authority, Tomas Marco, award-winning composer, critic, and bright light of Spanish music since the 1960s, covers the entire spectrum of composers and their works: trends and movements, critical and popular reception, national institutions, influences from Europe and beyond, and the effect of such historic events as the Spanish Civil War and the death of Franco. Marco's penetrating aesthetic critiques are threaded throughout each phase of this rich account. Marco provides detailed coverage of the key figures, induding a chapter devoted entirely to Manuel de Falla--Spain's most celebrated twentieth-century composer--and a panoramic survey of recent arrivals on the contemporary music scene. Exploring the rise and fall of the zarzuela, the author highlights innovative works in this authentic Spanish genre. He analyzes the attempts to find an audience for Spanish opera; demonstrates the flowering of symphonic and chamber music at the beginning of this century; traces currents such as romanticism, impressionism, and neoclassicism; and tracks the influence of Spain's distinctive regional folk traditions. Covering musical innovation after Spain's emergence from its period of isolation, Marco notes the speed with which many composers absorbed the work of Stravinsky and Bartok, the twelve-tone system, aleatory forms, electronic techniques, and other European developments. English-speaking scholars, musicians, critics and general readers have for decades been without full information on the rich and varied work coming out of Spain in this century. This lively history fills a long-felt need and fills it superbly, with the knowledge and insights of a major figure in the musical world.",['Tomás Marco'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5OypJWh20lUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5OypJWh20lUC&pg=PA114&dq=Spanish+Music+in+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harvard University Press,1993,http://books.google.com/books?id=5OypJWh20lUC&dq=Spanish+Music+in+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Music'],

Cleopatra of Egypt: From History to Myth.,"Fabled for her sexual allure and cunning intelligence, Cleopatra VII of Egypt has fascinated generations of admirers and detractors since her tumultuous life ended in suicide on Octavians' capture of Egypt in 30 BC. The last of the Ptolemaic monarchs who had ruled Egypt as Hellenistic Greek kings and Egyptian pharaohs for 300 years, Cleopatra created her own mythology, becoming an icon in her own lifetime and even more so after her death. This book explores the ways in which she was depicted in antiquity, within the context of the iconography of contemporary coinage, statues and other images of Egyptian, Greek and Roman rulers, and then examines the image of Cleopatra from the Renaissance to modern times, as seen in plays, opera, painting, ceramics and even jewellery. Exciting new research has revealed seven Egyptian-style statues believed to represent Cleopatra, and two portraits probably commissioned in Rome while she lived there with Julius Caesar.","['Susan Walker', 'Peter Higgs']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wL0UAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=wL0UAQAAIAAJ&q=Cleopatra+of+Egypt:+From+History+to+Myth.&dq=Cleopatra+of+Egypt:+From+History+to+Myth.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2001,http://books.google.com/books?id=wL0UAQAAIAAJ&dq=Cleopatra+of+Egypt:+From+History+to+Myth.&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Egypt'],1.0
Remember Me to My Father,"In her award-winning book Harmful to Minors, Judith Levine radically upended our fixed ideas about childhood. Now, she tackles the other end of life in this poignant memoir of a daughter coming to terms with a difficult father who is sinking into dementia, presenting an insightful exploration of the ways we think about disability, aging, and the self as it resides in the body and the world. In prose that is unsentimental yet moving, serious yet darkly funny, complex in emotion and ideas yet spare in diction, Levine reassembles her father's personal and professional history even as he is losing track of it. She unpeels the layers of his complicated personality and uncovers information that surprises even her mother, to whom her father has been married for more than sixty years. As her father deteriorates, the family consensus about who he was and is and how best to care for him constantly threatens to collapse. Levine recounts the painful discussions, mad outbursts, and gingerly negotiations, and dissects the shifting alliances among family, friends, and a changing guard of hired caretakers. Spending more and more time with her father, she confronts a relationship that has long felt bereft of love. By caring for his needs, she learns to care about and, slowly, to love him. While Levine chronicles these developments, she looks outside her family for the sources of their perceptions and expectations, deftly weaving politics, science, history, and philosophy into their personal story. A memoir opens up to become a critique of our culture's attitudes toward the elderley. A claustrophobic account of Alzheimer's is transformed into a complex lesson about love, duty, and community. What creates a self and keeps it whole? Levine insists that only the collaboration of others can safeguard her father's self against the riddling of his brain. Embracing interdependence and vulnerability, not autonomy and productivity, as the seminal elements of our humanity, Levine challenges herself and her readers to find new meaning, even hope, in one man's mortality and our own.",['Judith Levine'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m7tcMh5IBjEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=m7tcMh5IBjEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Remember+Me+to+My+Father&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2010-05-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m7tcMh5IBjEC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Reconciling Catholicism and Feminism?: Personal Reflections on Tradition and Change,"In this collection of essays, 22 writers, historians, theologians and feminists thoughtfully reflect on their own personal experiences with the Catholic Church. The essayists describe how they have, or in some cases have not, come to terms with a church that does not permit them full participation. In so doing, they offer practical suggestions for ways in which the Church can become more open to the concerns of its progressive members. Radford Ruether, who provides a brief history of 20th-century reform movements; internationally-known journalist Mary Kenny, who writes on the abortion debate in Ireland; Pulitzer Prize winner Madeleine Blais, who discusses her youth in parochial schools; short-story writer and New Yorker contributor Jean McGarry, who describes the clash of Catholic and secular cultures; and Grail co-founder Janet Kalven, who depicts the history of this widely recognized religious reform movement. Ebest provide context for these personal and poignant essays.

Together, she and her brother Michael are unbeatable but notoriety has its price. The police are determined to put Maura away once and for all - and not everyone in the family think that's such a bad idea. When it comes to the crunch, Maura has to face the pain of lost love in her past - and the dangerous lady discovers her heart is not made entirely of stone.

At its center lies Sherwin Nuland’s Rembrandtesque portrait of his father, Meyer Nudelman, a Jewish garment worker who came to America in the early years of the last century but remained an eternal outsider. Awkward in speech and movement, broken by the premature deaths of a wife and child, Meyer ruled his youngest son with a regime of rage, dependency, and helpless love that outlasted his death. In evoking their relationship, Nuland also summons up the warmth and claustrophobia of a vanished immigrant New York, a world that impelled its children toward success yet made them feel like traitors for leaving it behind.

"The Uplift War (The Uplift Saga, Book 3)","Hostile aliens take an Earth colony hostage in this New York Times–bestselling hard science fiction adventure by the author of Startide Rising. Although they were uplifted and given full sapience, the Bururalli clearly weren’t ready to run a planet, almost wrecking Garth. As a “salvage world,” it was given to despised Earthlings, assigned to reclaim it from the brink. Many senior Galactics—leaders of the Five Galaxies—hoped humanity would fail. But now Garth is peacefully surging back, tended by human and neo-chimpanzee colonists. Meanwhile, enemies desperately seek some way to coerce Earthclan, looking for a possible answer to the secret of the Progenitors. One of them—the Gubru avian race—prepares to invade and hold hostage defenseless Garth. With Earth itself under attack by other militant forces, no relief is coming for the embattled colonists.

"Cinderella Man: James Braddock, Max Baer, and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History","New York Times Bestseller: This true Depression-era story of a down-and-out fighter’s dramatic comeback is “a delight” (David Halberstam). James J. Braddock was a once promising light heavyweight. But a string of losses in the ring and a broken right hand happened to coincide with the Great Crash of 1929—and Braddock was forced to labor on the docks of Hoboken. Only his manager, Joe Gould, still believed in him. Gould looked out for the burly, quiet Irishman, finding matches for Braddock to help him feed his wife and children. Together, they were about to stage the greatest comeback in fighting history. Within twelve months, Braddock went from being on the relief rolls to facing heavyweight champion Max Baer, renowned for having allegedly killed two men in the ring. A brash Jewish boxer from the West Coast, Baer was heavily favored—but Braddock carried the hopes and dreams of the working class on his shoulders, and when he emerged victorious against all odds, the shock was palpable—and the cheers were deafening. In the wake of his surprise win, Damon Runyon dubbed him “Cinderella Man.” Against the gritty backdrop of the 1930s, Cinderella Man brings this dramatic all-American story to life, telling a classic David and Goliath tale that transcends the sport. “A punchy read with touches of humor.” —The New York Times “A wonderful, thrilling boxing story, and simultaneously a meticulous look at Depression life.” —Jimmy Breslin",['Jeremy Schaap'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=an2YBlOe_xQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=an2YBlOe_xQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cinderella+Man:+James+Braddock,+Max+Baer,+and+the+Greatest+Upset+in+Boxing+History&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",HMH,2012-07-27,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=an2YBlOe_xQC&source=gbs_api,['Sports & Recreation'],

"Dear Mom, Dad & Ethel: World War II through the Eyes of a Radio Man","Much has been written both about and by people who feel they were assigned the wrong body at conception, exploring the struggles and too often the tragedies that result from that mismatch of nature. Very little has been written, however, to chronicle the lifelong struggle of people to understand and come to terms with two distinct sets of emotions, one male and one female – a single soul, at times divided, at times united, by two clearly identifiable spirits. Dear Mom and Dad: You Don’t Know Me, But ... traces the life of George through the eyes of Georgia, the female half of their soul, from early childhood in the post war Texas oil fields through the innocence of his early school years in northeastern Oklahoma. With the onset of puberty, Georgia watches the omnipresent feeling of not being normal cast a destructive pall over nearly everything George attempts. After the collapse of his lifelong dream, George begins again with hopes, new dreams and the love they’ve both longed for. Georgia finally emerges, but understanding her part in their soul comes slowly and is complicated by a tragedy of profound proportion. Dear Mom and Dad considers the ultimate understanding of God’s will for both George and Georgia and its unusual conclusion, sharing a story of struggle and self-acceptance.",['Georgia Lee McGowen'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BV8TCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=BV8TCwAAQBAJ&pg=PR1&dq=Dear+Mom,+Dad&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",iUniverse,2012-07-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BV8TCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Quantum Mechanics: Fundamentals,"Quantum mechanics was already an old and solidly established subject when the first edition of this book appeared in 1966. The context in which a graduate text on quantum mechanics is studied today has changed a good deal, however. In 1966, most entering physics graduate students had a quite limited exposure to quan tum mechanics in the form of wave mechanics. Today the standard undergraduate curriculum contains a large dose of elementary quantum mechanics, and often intro duces the abstract formalism due to Dirac. Back then, the study of the foundations by theorists and experimenters was close to dormant, and very few courses spent any time whatever on this topic. At that very time, however, John Bell's famous theorem broke the ice, and there has been a great flowering ever since, especially in the laboratory thanks to the development of quantum optics, and more recently because of the interest in quantum computing. And back then, the Feynman path integral was seen by most as a very imaginative but rather useless formulation of quantum mechanics, whereas it now plays a large role in statistical physics and quantum field theory, especially in computational work. For these and other reasons, this book is not just a revision of the 1966 edition. It has been rewritten throughout, is differently organized, and goes into greater depth on many topics that were in the old edition.","['Kurt Gottfried', 'Tung-Mow Yan']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D4vaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=D4vaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Quantum+Mechanics:+Fundamentals&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Springer Science & Business Media,2013-12-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D4vaBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Science'],

Eventually forced to fall back by overwhelming German numbers, the British carried out a masterful fighting retreat across Belgium and northern France.

The Hounding,"'David Oluwale's story has a raw power...and Kester Aspden makes it relevant for the reader of today' Mishal Husain An award-winning microhistory that examines the death of David Oluwale and institutionalised police racism in Britain. When, in May 1969, the body of David Oluwale was found in the River Aire near Leeds, few questions were asked about the circumstances of his death. Oluwale was homeless and had spent time in a psychiatric hospital, an immigrant from Nigeria who was trapped in a system that had failed him miserably. Eighteen months later a lengthy campaign of harassment by two Leeds policemen was uncovered - Oluwale became national news in Britain, and a symbol for its black community. This extraordinary book draws on original archival material only recently released to revisit one of the most chilling crimes in British history, and at the same time raises questions as relevant today as they were at the end of the sixties.

The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives,"This comprehensive work of cultural history gives us something we have never had: a view of the Crusades as seen through Muslim eyes. With breathtaking command of medieval Muslim sources as well as the vast literature on medieval European and Muslim culture, Carole Hillenbrand has produced a book that shows not only how the Crusades were perceived by the Muslims, but how the Crusades affected the Muslim world - militarily, culturally, and psychologically. As the author demonstrates, that influence continues now, centuries after the events. In The Crusades the reader discovers how the Muslims reacted to the Franks, and how Muslim populations were displaced, the ensuing period of jihad, the careers of Nur al-Din and Saladin, and the interpenetration of Muslim and Christian cultures. Stereotypes of the Franks in Muslim documents offer a fascinating counter to Western views of the infidel of legend. For readers interested in the Middle Ages, military history, the history of religion, and postcolonial studies, The Crusades opens a window onto a conflict we have only viewed from one side. The Crusades is richly illustrated, with eighteen color plates and over five hundred line drawings and black and white photographs.",['Carole Hillenbrand'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UalnoF5MBHMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UalnoF5MBHMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Crusades:+Islamic+Perspectives&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Psychology Press,2000,http://books.google.com/books?id=UalnoF5MBHMC&dq=The+Crusades:+Islamic+Perspectives&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0

"Growing Up Female in Nazi Germany (Social History, Popular Culture, and Politics in Germany)","Growing Up Female in Nazi Germany explores the world of the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM), the female section within the Hitler Youth that included almost all German girls aged 10 to 14. The BDM is often enveloped in myths; German girls were brought up to be the compliant handmaidens of National Socialism, their mental horizon restricted to the ""three Ks"" of Kinder, Küche, Kirche (children, kitchen, and church). Dagmar Reese, however, depicts another picture of life in the BDM. She explores how and in what way the National Socialists were successful in linking up with the interests of contemporary girls and young women and providing them a social life of their own. The girls in the BDM found latitude for their own development while taking on responsibilities that integrated them within the folds of the National Socialist state. ""At last available in English, this pioneering study provides fresh insights into the ways in which the Nazi regime changed young 'Aryan' women's lives through appeals to female self-esteem that were not obviously defined by Nazi ideology, but drove a wedge between parents and children. Thoughtful analysis of detailed interviews reveals the day-to-day functioning of the Third Reich in different social milieus and its impact on women's lives beyond 1945. A must-read for anyone interested in the gendered dynamics of Nazi modernity and the lack of sustained opposition to National Socialism."" --Uta Poiger, University of Washington ""In this highly readable translation, Reese provocatively identifies Nazi girls league members' surprisingly positive memories and reveals significant implications for the functioning of Nazi society.

The golden cage: The enigma of anorexia nervosa,"First published more than twenty years ago, with almost 150,000 copies sold, The Golden Cage is still the classic book on anorexia nervosa, for patients, parents, mental health trainees, and senior therapists alike. Writing in direct, jargon-free style, often quoting her patients' descriptions of their own experience of illness and recovery, Bruch describes the relentless pursuit of thinness and the search for superiority in self-denial that characterizes anorexia nervosa. She emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and offers guidance on danger signs. Little-known when this groundbreaking book was first published, eating disorders have become all too familiar. Sympathetic and astute, The Golden Cage now speaks to a new generation. ""The story of the disorder itself is beautifully written, presented with a deftness, lightness, and accuracy that make the reader yearn to turn the page, to watch the unfolding of this very enigmatic disorder. This is the single most important professionally written book for laypersons and parents."" -Shervert H. Frazier, M.D., McLean Hospital ""The Golden Cage is eminently readable and generously spiced with vivid illustrations from Bruch's own clinical case material. Her discussion of and generalization from this material is wonderfully astute."" -Contemporary Psychology Hilde Bruch was Professor of Psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicineand the author of Learning Psychotherapy: Rationale and Ground Rules (Harvard) and Eating Disorders.",['Hilde Bruch'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T0JcmoPPf78C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=T0JcmoPPf78C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+golden+cage:+The+enigma+of+anorexia+nervosa&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harvard University Press,2001,http://books.google.com/books?id=T0JcmoPPf78C&dq=The+golden+cage:+The+enigma+of+anorexia+nervosa&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],2.0

Frida Kahlo: 1907-1954 (Spanish Edition),"A tradition rooted in the mythology of romanticism and its conception of the artist as a cultural hero would want to believe that everything pertaining to the life of a genius has to bear the mark of the sublime. Everything in their lives -gestures, decisions, personality traits, eccentricities, even the most dissonant mistakes- are thus transformed into esthetic substance. We would want their lives to be masterworks, a perfect coherence- and continuity between the work and its creator. Roland Barthes has criticized this conception as a basically bourgeois aberration - the perennial realism of the bourgeois culture, its need to identify the signified with the signifier. And then we learn about the real human dimension of these heroes- their pettiness, narcissism, avariciousness, arbitrariness, and childishness, all of which are no more than their human specificity. We are scandalized; either the work or the figure lies. A harmonious painting, a novel or masterful symphony cannot possibly be the product of a person capable of such spiritual smallness. Then we are left with two choices—to dismiss the work as an essentially hypocritical utterance, or to disqualify the creator as the accidental author of some work that happened to be marvelous but was simply by virtue of a great skill, not supported by an equally admirable human quality.",['Isolda P.

Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by ""an enormous thing,"" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length—we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.",['Jules Verne'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=20,000+Leagues+Under+the+Sea+(Classics+Illustrated+-+Featuring+Stories+by+the+World%27s+Greatest+Authors.,+47)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Library of Alexandria,2020-09-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,,

Something to Declare,"“Julia Alvarez has suitcases full of history (public and private), trunks full of insights into what it means to be a Latina in the United States, bags full of literary wisdom.” —Los Angeles Times From the internationally acclaimed author of the bestselling novels In the Time of the Butterflies and How the García Girls Lost Their Accents comes a rich and revealing work of nonfiction capturing the life and mind of an artist as she knits together the dual themes of coming to America and becoming a writer. The twenty-four confessional, evocative essays that make up Something to Declare are divided into two parts. “Customs” includes Alvarez’s memories of her family’s life in the Dominican Republic, fleeing from Trujillo’s dictatorship, and arriving in America when she was ten years old. She examines the effects of exile--surviving the shock of New York City life; yearning to fit in; training her tongue (and her mind) to speak English; and watching the Miss America pageant for clues about American-style beauty. The second half, “Declarations,” celebrates her passion for words and the writing life. She lets us watch as she struggles with her art--searching for a subject for her next novel, confronting her characters, facing her family’s anger when she invades their privacy, reflecting on the writers who influenced her, and continually honing her craft. The winner of the National Medal of Arts for her extraordinary storytelling, Julia Alvarez here offers essays that are an inspiring gift to readers and writers everywhere. “This beautiful collection of essays . . . traces a process of personal reconciliation with insight, humor, and quiet power.” —San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle “Reading Julia Alvarez’s new collection of essays is like curling up with a glass of wine in one hand and the phone in the other, listening to a bighearted, wisecracking friend share the hard-earned wisdom about family, identity, and the art of writing.” —People",['Julia Alvarez'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CDiCENJbc4oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=CDiCENJbc4oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Something+to+Declare&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Algonquin Books,1998-08-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CDiCENJbc4oC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],1.0

A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic of the Byzantine Period (Publications of The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon Project),"Since the Middle Ages, lexographies of Talmudic and other rabbinic literature have combined in one entry Babylonian, Palestinian, and Targumic words from various periods. Because morphologically identical words in even closely related dialects can frequently differ in both meaning and nuance, their consolidation into one dictionary entry is often misleading. Scholars now realize the need to treat each dialect separately, and in A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Michael Sokoloff provides a complete lexicon of the dialect spoken and written by Jews in Palestine during the Byzantine period, from the third century C.E. to the tenth century. Sokoloff draws on a wide range of sources, from inscriptions discovered in the remains of synagogues and on amulets, fragments of letters and other documents, poems, and marginal notations to local Targumim, the Palestinian Midrashim and Talmud, texts addressing religious law (halacha), and Palestinian marriage documents (ketubbot) from the Arabic period. Many of these sources were unavailable to previous lexographers, who based their dictionaries on corrupt nineteenth-century editions of the rabbinic literature. The discovery of new manuscripts in both European libraries and the Cairo Geniza over the course of the twentieth century has revolutionized the textual basis of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic. Each entry in A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic is divided into six parts: lemma or root, part of speech, English gloss, etymology, semantic features, and bibliographic references. Sokoloff also includes an index of all cited passages. This major reference work, updated to reflect the publication of new texts over the last decade, will both provide students and scholars with a tool for an accurate understanding of the Aramaic dialect of Jewish Palestinian literature of the Byzantine period and help Aramaist and Semitic linguists to see the relationship between this dialect and others, especially the contemporary dialects of Palestine.","[""Mîk̲ā'ēl Sôqôlôv"", 'Michael Sokoloff']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rlYSW4-a7JoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=rlYSW4-a7JoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Dictionary+of+Jewish+Palestinian+Aramaic+of+the+Byzantine+Period+(Publications+of+The+Comprehensive+Aramaic+Lexicon+Project)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,JHU Press,2002,http://books.google.com/books?id=rlYSW4-a7JoC&dq=A+Dictionary+of+Jewish+Palestinian+Aramaic+of+the+Byzantine+Period+(Publications+of+The+Comprehensive+Aramaic+Lexicon+Project)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0

"The Right Questions: Truth, Meaning and Public Debate","An ECPA 2003 Gold Medallion Finalist! Phillip E. Johnson pries the lid off public debate about questions of ultimate concern--questions often suppressed by our society's intellectual elite. Moving far beyond matters of creation and evolution, Johnson outlines the questions we all ought to be asking about the meaning of human history, the limits of scientific inquiry, religion and education in a pluralistic society, truth, liberty and moral choices, and God and His Word, Jesus Christ. Johnson deftly demonstrates how the reigning naturalistic philosophy not only squelches public debate but also constrains us to ask the wrong questions. Unless we start with the right questions, Johnson argues, our discussions will be framed by the assumptions of that very philosophy which must be challenged. Johnson asserts that even the Christian church has much too often passively accepted this limiting frame of mind to the detriment of all. But Christian faith and conviction instead ought to lead in opening up the search for truth and meaning through the kind of public education that ""teaches in controversy."" Then all of us will be prepared to engage in lively, informed and civil debate about the questions that really matter. Why is it always wrong to mix science and religion? What is the ultimate premise, the beginning point, from which logic should proceed?

Medievalism and the Modernist Temper (Parallax: Re-visions of Culture and Society),"""While modernists are currently so mired in the question of who did what to whom during World War II that they have lost a sense of intellectual urgency, the study of medieval literature and culture has never been more alive or at a more interestingly innovative stage."" -- from the Introduction Medievalism and the Modernist Temper brings major and outstanding younger medievalists into confrontation with the notion of medievalism itself in order to chart the directions the field has taken in the past and may take in the future. The collection not only explores modern conceptions of cultural patterns in the Middle Ages but also makes a significant contribution to the wider field of sociology of knowledge in the humanities. In its largest sense, it is a study of the institution of modern scholarship, using medieval literature as a focus. Contributors are R. Howard Bloch, Alain Boureau, E. Jane Burns, Michael Camille, Alain Corbellari, John M. Ganim, John M. Graham, Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, Suzanne Fleischman, David Hult, Carl Landauer, Seth Lerer, Stephen G. Nichols, Per Nykrog, and Jeffrey M. Peck. ""This highly original, polemical and paradigm-shifting book challenges academics to look more closely at the ideological foundations of the very disciplines we practice. Perhaps its most extraordinary contribution to literary studies as a whole (and it emerges with luminous clarity from the editors' Introduction) is to offer a new, historicized means of reviving what was once known as 'source studies.'"" -- Jody Enders, University of California, Santa Barbara","['R.

The Queening of America,"Since at least the end of the nineteenth century, gay culture - its humour, its icons, its desires - has been alive and sometimes even visible in the midst of straight American society. David Van Leer puts forward here a series of readings that aim to identify what he calls the ""queening"" of America, a process by which ""rhetorics and situations specific to homosexual culture are presented to a general readership as if culturally neutral."" The Queening of America examines how the invisibility of gay male writing, especially in the popular culture of the 1950s and 1960s, facilitated the crossing of gay motifs in straight culture. Van Leer then critiques some current models of making homosexuality visible (the packaging of Joe Orton, the theories of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, the rise of gay studies), before concluding more optimistically with the possible alliances between gay culture and other minority discourses.",['David Van Leer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ewpW0aRORS4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ewpW0aRORS4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Queening+of+America&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Psychology Press,1995,http://books.google.com/books?id=ewpW0aRORS4C&dq=The+Queening+of+America&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Art'],

Carefully preserving the original work's acclaimed narrative style and combination of biography, intellectual history, and literary criticism, Dostoevsky: A Writer in His Time illuminates the writer's works--from his first novel Poor Folk to Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov--by setting them in their personal, historical, and above all ideological context.

Jesus;: A new biography,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “A lucid, intelligent page-turner” (Los Angeles Times) that challenges long-held assumptions about Jesus, from the host of Believer Two thousand years ago, an itinerant Jewish preacher walked across the Galilee, gathering followers to establish what he called the “Kingdom of God.” The revolutionary movement he launched was so threatening to the established order that he was executed as a state criminal. Within decades after his death, his followers would call him God. Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history’s most enigmatic figures by examining Jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived. Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction. He explores the reasons the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity. Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus’ life and mission. Praise for Zealot “Riveting . . . Aslan synthesizes Scripture and scholarship to create an original account.”—The New Yorker “Fascinatingly and convincingly drawn . . . Aslan may come as close as one can to respecting those who revere Jesus as the peace-loving, turn-the-other-cheek, true son of God depicted in modern Christianity, even as he knocks down that image.”—The Seattle Times “[Aslan’s] literary talent is as essential to the effect of Zealot as are his scholarly and journalistic chops. . . . A vivid, persuasive portrait.”—Salon “This tough-minded, deeply political book does full justice to the real Jesus, and honors him in the process.”—San Francisco Chronicle “A special and revealing work, one that believer and skeptic alike will find surprising, engaging, and original.”—Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power “Compulsively readable . . .

Literary Culture in Taiwan: Martial Law to Market Law,"With monumental changes in the last two decades, Taiwan is making itself anew. The process requires remapping not only the country's recent political past, but also its literary past. Taiwanese literature is now compelled to negotiate a path between residual high culture aspirations and the emergent reality of market domination in a relatively autonomous, increasingly professionalized field. This book argues that the concept of a field of cultural production is essential to accounting for the ways in which writers and editors respond to political and economic forces. It traces the formation of dominant concepts of literature, competing literary trends, and how these ideas have met political and market challenges. Contemporary Taiwanese literature has often been neglected and misrepresented by literary historians both inside and outside of Taiwan. Chang provides a comprehensive and fluent history of late twentieth-century Taiwanese literature by placing this vibrant tradition within the contexts of a modernizing local economy, a globalizing world economy, and a postcolonial and post-Cold War world order.",['Sung-sheng Yvonne Chang'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7IAgsLtU9XIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=7IAgsLtU9XIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Literary+Culture+in+Taiwan:+Martial+Law+to+Market+Law&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Columbia University Press,2004-10-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7IAgsLtU9XIC&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

On June 14, 1962, twenty-five-year-old Juris Slesers arrived at his mother’s apartment to drive her to church. But there was no answer at the door. When he pushed his way inside, Juris found Anna Slesers dead on the kitchen floor, the cord of her housecoat knotted tightly around her neck. Over the next two years, twelve more bodies were discovered in and around Boston: all women, all sexually assaulted, and all strangled. None of the victims exhibited any signs of struggle, nothing was stolen from their homes, and there were no signs of forcible entry. The police could find no discernable motive or clues. Who was this madman? How was he entering women’s homes? And what insanity was driving him?

"Interrogating Inequality: Essays on Class Analysis, Socialism and Marxism","This lively new collection from one of America's leading sociologists covers a wide range of theoretical problems of interest to radical social scientists and political activists. The book opens with a fascinating autobiographical essay exploring the challenges and benefits of being a Marxist scholar in the present era. Following this is a discussion of various issues in class analysis, with particular attention being paid to two overarching themes: class and inequality, and the relationship between class and power. The second section of the book engages the problem of socialism as a possible future to capitalism. Wright attempts to clarify the conceptual status of socialism, and discusses why certain reforms such as basic income grants may ultimately require the introduction of some form of socialism for their full realization. Interrogating Inequality concludes by examining the general problem of Marxism as a tradition of radical social theory.

Twice a Hero,"A time-travel romance “with all the grace and sensuality readers have come to expect from” the New York Times–bestselling author of Star-Crossed (Library Journal). To lift a family curse, MacKenzie Sinclair heads to the Guatemalan jungle to return an amulet her great-great grandfather, Perry Sinclair, took from a Mayan temple. On that same expedition, his partner, Liam O’Shea, disappeared—possibly betrayed or killed by Perry—which started the Sinclair family’s string of bad luck. Once at the ruins of the ancient city of Tikal, Mac is sent back in time to 1884—and into the life of Liam O’Shea. Together with the headstrong, honorable, and disarmingly handsome adventurer, Mac has a chance to turn the tide of history—and the fortunes of her own heart.

The Junction Boys: How Ten Days in Hell With Bear Bryant Forged a Championship Team,"The legendary Paul ""Bear"" Bryant is recognized nationwide as one of the greatest coaches ever. So why did he always cite his 1-9 A&M team of 1954 as his favorite? This is the story of a remarkable team - and the beginning of the legend. The Junction Boys tells the story of Coach Paul ""Bear"" Bryant's legendary training camp in the small town of Junction, Texas. In a move that many consider the salvation of the Texas A&M football program, Coach Bryant put 115 players through the most grueling practices ever imagined. Only a handful of players survived the entire 10 days, but they braved the intense heat of the Texas sun and the burning passion of their coach, and turned a floundering team into one of the nation's best. The Junction Boys is more than just a story of tough practices without water breaks. An extraordinary fellowship was forged from the mind-numbing pain. The thirty-five survivors bonded together like no other team in America. They profited from the Junction experience; the knowledge they took back with them to College Station, about themselves and what they were capable of, would be used for the rest of their lives. In vivid and powerful images reminiscent of Friday Night Lights, Hoosiers, and The Last Picture Show, these young men and their driven coach come to life. The Junction Boys contains all the hallmarks of a classic sports story, and it combines America's love of college football with an extraordinary story of perseverance and triumph.",['Jim Dent'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=09mXlyijC_cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=09mXlyijC_cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Junction+Boys:+How+Ten+Days+in+Hell+With+Bear+Bryant+Forged+a+Championship+Team&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Macmillan,2000-09-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=09mXlyijC_cC&source=gbs_api,['Sports & Recreation'],2.0

Propaganda;: The formation of men's attitudes,"From one of the greatest French philosophers of the 20th century, comes a seminal study and critique of propaganda. Taking not only a psychological approach, but a sociological approach as well, Ellul's book outlines the taxonomy for propaganda, and ultimately, it's destructive nature towards democracy. Drawing from his own experiences fighting for the French resistance against the Vichy regime, Ellul offers a unique insight into the propaganda machine. ""A far more frightening work than any of the nightmare novels of George Orwell. With the logic which is the great instrument of French thought, Ellul] explores and attempts to prove the thesis that propaganda, whether its ends are demonstrably good or bad, is not only destructive to democracy, it is perhaps the most serious threat to humanity operating in the modern world.""--Los Angeles ""The theme of Propaganda is quite simply . . . that when our new technology encompasses any culture or society, the result is propaganda . . .

"Childhood Experiences of Domestic Violence: The Herd, Primal Horde, Crowds and Masses","Annotation Children's Experiences of Domestic Violence focuses on first-hand accounts from children and young people regarding their experiences of both domestic violence and support services. It is the first book to examine the user's experience of service provision for the victims of domestic violence and it seeks to encourage a more effective and professional approach in the services that serve to support and protect children. The book is based on a unique, three-year research project into child support and protection services that began in 1996. The book examines such topics as; the types of violence experienced by mothers and witnessed by children; the types of abuse children are subjected to; children's understanding of domestic violence; children's and mother's views of how best to protect children and their perception of the support services; and the barriers for children and mothers seeking help. The book assesses the role and response of the social services, police, voluntary organizations and the agencies, of health, education, and housing. It describes approaches to existing problems, emphasizing a child-focused response and concludes by recommending improvements for policy and practice.",['Caroline McGee'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AYlGFvUSdOoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=AYlGFvUSdOoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Childhood+Experiences+of+Domestic+Violence:+The+Herd,+Primal+Horde,+Crowds+and+Masses&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Jessica Kingsley Publishers,2000,"http://books.google.com/books?id=AYlGFvUSdOoC&dq=Childhood+Experiences+of+Domestic+Violence:+The+Herd,+Primal+Horde,+Crowds+and+Masses&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Social Science'],

Government By The People,"Between 1898 and 1918, many American states introduced the initiative, referendum, and recall--known collectively as direct democracy. Most interpreters have seen the motives for these reform measures as purely political, but Thomas Goebel demonstrates that the call for direct democracy was deeply rooted in antimonopoly sentiment. Frustrated with the governmental corruption and favoritism that facilitated the rise of monopolies, advocates of direct democracy aimed to check the influence of legislative bodies and directly empower the people to pass laws and abolish trusts. But direct democracy failed to achieve its promises: corporations and trusts continued to flourish, voter turnout rates did not increase, and interest groups grew stronger. By the 1930s, it was clear that direct democracy favored large organizations with the financial and organizational resources to fund increasingly expensive campaigns. Recent years have witnessed a resurgence of direct democracy, particularly in California, where ballot questions and propositions have addressed such volatile issues as gay rights and affirmative action. In this context, Goebel's analysis of direct democracy's history, evolution, and ultimate unsuitability as a grassroots tool is particularly timely.",['Thomas Goebel'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xy7d75BTKDYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Xy7d75BTKDYC&pg=PP1&dq=Government+By+The+People&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Univ of North Carolina Press,2003-04-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xy7d75BTKDYC&source=gbs_api,['History'],

The Half-Life of Happiness,"From the winner of the 1989 National Book Award (for Spartina), a major new novel--wise, sad, and richly comic--about the meltdown of a marriage against the backdrop of a gloriously awful congressional campaign. Charlottesville, Virginia, 1978: Mike is a successful forty-something lawyer, a onetime congressional staffer who's had it with Washington; Joss, his wife, is a filmmaker. They're Virginia liberals with a clan of close-knit friends--a bright, edgy, flirty, games-playing group, spinning like a Catherine wheel around Mike and Joss. But the sparks that fly between the two are getting hotter and more dangerous, as Joss' restlessness turns to impatience and then anger. When one of the group introduces them all to the woman he wants to marry, things suddenly explode--this new arrival and Joss fall passionately in love, and their whole world careens out of control. What ensues is tragicomedy, as Mike tries to allay his rage and misery by letting himself get sucked into a trial run for a seat in Congress. He wants to be a hero to someone; instead he becomes the unwitting star of a political farce. Meantime, Joss is struggling with her new life, and their two young daughters (who form a lovingly unmerciful Greek chorus commenting on the action) have to navigate a turmoil in which one parent is a public joke and the other a private scandal. Rarely has the undoing of love been chronicled with such large-hearted humanity.",['John Casey'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-o1KCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=-o1KCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Half-Life+of+Happiness&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2015-08-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-o1KCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

This full commentary - predominately a literary and historical criticism - is based on and includes a new translation and is accompanied by essays on Benedict's spiritual doctrine. A monk who has striven to live according to the Rule of Benedict for thirty-five years, Father Kardong relates it to modern monastic life while examining the sources (Cassian, Augustine, and Basil) Benedict used to establish his Rule. Overviews - summaries of notes, source criticism, or structural criticism - follow some chapters, and a large bibliography of the current scholarship and source references are also included. Benedict's Rule: A Translation and Commentary also includes the Latin text of the Regula Benedicti. This reference work is invaluable to libraries and to those who are called to interpret the Rule.

Leaving Lancaster County,"Gould Offers a New Amish Series in Idyllic Lancaster County At age twenty, Jessica Bachman left her two beloved sisters and her Amish community after clashing with the new bishop about her role in the family and the future of their farm. She tried to convince Silas Kemp, who'd been courting her for two years, to join her, but when he said no, she fled anyway. Three years later, she returns home for the first time since leaving Lancaster to attend her father's funeral. Her arrival back revives all sorts of emotions--yearnings and sorrows alike. Jessica knows things will never return to how they were. But in seeing Silas again, she can't help but wonder what might have been. Struggling to decide where her next step should take her, she learns the story of a Revolutionary War-era ancestor that echoes her own choices. Will Jessica leave her family and community forever, or is there peace and healing and love yet to come?",['Leslie Gould'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QwDDDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QwDDDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Leaving+Lancaster+County&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bethany House,2017-10-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QwDDDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],4.0

The Middle East,"It’s time for new policies based on changing U.S. interests U.S. policy in the Middle East has had very few successes in recent years, so maybe it’s time for a different approach. But is the new approach of the Trump administration—military disengagement coupled with unquestioning support for key allies--Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia—the way forward? In this edited volume, noted experts on the region lay out a better long-term strategy for protecting U.S. interests in the Middle East. The authors articulate a vision that is both self-interested and carefully tailored to the unique dynamics of the increasingly divergent sub-regions in the Middle East, including North Africa, the Sunni Arab bloc of Egypt and Persian Gulf states, and the increasingly chaotic Levant. The book argues that the most effective way to pursue and protect U.S. interests is unlikely to involve the same alliance-centric approach that has been the basis of Washington’s policy since the 1990s. Instead, the United States should adopt a nimbler and less military-dominant strategy that relies on a diversified set of partners and a determination to establish priorities for American interests and the use of resources, both financial and military. In essence, the book calls for a new post-Obama and post-Trump approach to the region that reflects the fact that U.S. interests are changing and likely will continue to change. The book offers a fresh perspective in advance of the 2020 presidential election.","['Dafna H. Rand', 'Andrew P.

The Black,"Until now, the single most important unpublished work by C.G. Jung—The Black Books. In 1913, C.G. Jung started a unique self- experiment that he called his “confrontation with the unconscious”: an engagement with his fantasies in a waking state, which he charted in a series of notebooks referred to as The Black Books. These intimate writings shed light on the further elaboration of Jung’s personal cosmology and his attempts to embody insights from his self- investigation into his life and personal relationships. The Red Book drew on material recorded from 1913 to 1916, but Jung actively kept the notebooks for many more decades. Presented in a magnificent, seven-volume boxed collection featuring a revelatory essay by noted Jung scholar Sonu Shamdasani—illuminated by a selection of Jung’s vibrant visual works—and both translated and facsimile versions of each notebook, The Black Books offer a unique portal into Jung’s mind and the origins of analytical psychology.",['C.

We Shall Not Sleep: A Novel,"""An utterly compelling novel from a brilliant new voice."" --M. L. Stedman, author of The Light Between Oceans For generations they've shared the small Maine island of Seven, but the Hillsingers and the Quicks have always kept apart, even since before Jim Hillsinger and Billy Quick married sisters. When Jim is ousted from the CIA under suspicion of treason, he begins to suspect that he has been betrayed--by his brother-in-law, Billy, and also by his own wife, Lila. In retaliation, he decides to carry out an old threat: to send their twelve-year-old son, Catta, to a neighboring island to test his survival skills. Set over three summer days in 1964, Estep Nagy's debut novel moves among the communities of Seven--the families, the servants, and the children--as longstanding tensions become tactical face-offs in which love, loss, and long-held secrets become brutal ammunition. Vividly capturing the rift between the cold warriors of Jim's generation and the rebellious seekers of Catta's, We Shall Not All Sleep is a richly told story of American class, family, and manipulation, and a compelling portrait of a unique and privileged enclave on the brink of dissolution.",['Estep Nagy'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vtksDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=vtksDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=We+Shall+Not+Sleep:+A+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2017-07-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vtksDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],3.0

Two Men Before the Storm: Arba Crane's Recollection of Dred Scott And the Supreme Court Case That Started the Civil War,"In the early 1850s, Arba Crane, a young Harvard Law School graduate, arrived in St Louis to begin his law career. Working alone late in the evenings, Crane forms a friendship with the office janitor, a slave named Dred Scott. As Scott recounts his life as a slave, Crane realizes that Scott has a legal claim to freedom and persuades him to file a lawsuit. Crane fights for Scott's rights for years. The case reaches the US Supreme Court before a spellbound country. But the Court's catastrophic decision in Scott v. Sandford holds that slaves are property without rights and that Congress has no power to halt the spread of slavery. While the decision marks the beginning of the path to civil war, it is not the end of Dred Scott's quest for freedom. Two Men Before the Storm is a work of fiction (with detailed historical endnotes) based on historical events: the profound friendship between a young lawyer and a slave and a fight for justice that fundamentally changed our nation.",['Gregory Wallance'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BtVAAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=BtVAAQAAIAAJ&q=Two+Men+Before+the+Storm:+Arba+Crane%27s+Recollection+of+Dred+Scott+And+the+Supreme+Court+Case+That+Started+the+Civil+War&dq=Two+Men+Before+the+Storm:+Arba+Crane%27s+Recollection+of+Dred+Scott+And+the+Supreme+Court+Case+That+Started+the+Civil+War&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Greenleaf Book Group Llc,2006,http://books.google.com/books?id=BtVAAQAAIAAJ&dq=Two+Men+Before+the+Storm:+Arba+Crane%27s+Recollection+of+Dred+Scott+And+the+Supreme+Court+Case+That+Started+the+Civil+War&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

A Book of Emblems: The Emblematum Liber in Latin and English,"Andrea Alciati's Emblematum Liber was an essential work for every writer, artist and scholar in post-medieval Europe. First published in 1531, this illustrated book was a collection of emblems, each consisting of a motto or proverb, a typically enigmatic illustration, and a short explanation. Most of the emblems had symbolic and moral applications. Scholars depended on Alciati's book to interpret contemporary art and literature, while writers and artists turned to it to invest their work with an understood didactic sense. This new edition of the Emblematum Liber includes the original Latin texts, highly readable English translations, and the illustrations belonging to each of the 212 emblems. The editor's introduction explains both the importance and the cultural contexts of Alciati's book, as well as its innumerable artistic applications. For instance, close study of the emblems reveals--to cite only two examples--why statues of lions are traditionally placed before government buildings, and what underlying political message was conveyed by innumerable equestrian portraits during the Baroque era. The collection includes as an appendix the formerly suppressed emblem, ""Adversus Naturam Peccantes,"" accompanied by a translation of the learned commentary applied to it by Johann Thuilius in 1612. An extensive bibliography points the student to scholarly research specifically dealing with artistic applications of Alciati's emblems. Altogether, this new edition of Alciati's seminal work is an essential tool for modern students of the liberal arts.",['Andrea Alciati'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_nKuBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_nKuBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Book+of+Emblems:+The+Emblematum+Liber+in+Latin+and+English&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,McFarland,2004-07-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=_nKuBAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Book+of+Emblems:+The+Emblematum+Liber+in+Latin+and+English&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Art'],

On thermonuclear war,"On Thermonuclear War was controversial when originally published and remains so today. It is iconoclastic, crosses disciplinary boundaries, and finally it is calm and compellingly reasonable. The book was widely read on both sides of the Iron Curtain and the result was serious revision in both Western and Soviet strategy and doctrine. As a result, both sides were better able to avoid disaster during the Cold War. The strategic concepts still apply: defense, local animosities, and the usual balance-of-power issues are still very much with us. Kahn's stated purpose in writing this book was simply: ""avoiding disaster and buying time, without specifying the use of this time."" By the late 1950s, with both sides H-bomb-armed, reason and time were in short supply. Kahn, a military analyst at Rand since 1948, understood that a defense based only on thermonuclear arnaments was inconceivable, morally questionable, and not credible. The book was the first to make sense of nuclear weapons. Originally created from a series of lectures, it provides insight into how policymakers consider such issues. One may agree with Kahn or disagree with him on specific issues, but he clearly defined the terrain of the argument. He also looks at other weapons of mass destruction such as biological and chemical, and the history of their use. The Cold War is over, but the nuclear genie is out of the bottle, and the lessons and principles developed in On Thermonuclear War apply as much to today's China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as they did to the Soviets.",['Herman Kahn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EN2gtPTjFd8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EN2gtPTjFd8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=On+thermonuclear+war&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Transaction Publishers,2011-12-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EN2gtPTjFd8C&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],1.0

Philosophy After Postmodernism: Civilized Values and the Scope of Knowledge (Routledge Studies in Twentieth Century Philosophy),"Formulating a new approach to philosophy which, instead of simply rejecting postmodern thought, tries to assimilate some of its main features, Paul Crowther identifies conceptual links between value, knowledge, personal identity and civilization understood as a process of cumulative advance. To establish these links, Crowther deploys a mode of analytic philosophy influenced by Cassirer. This approach recontextualizes precisely those aspects of postmodernism which appear, superficially, to be fuel for the relativist fire. This method also enables him to illuminate some of the great practical dangers of the postmodern era - most notably the widespread inability or unwillingness to distinguish between signs and reality. Crowther renews analytic philosophy as a searching form of conceptual and cultural critique that pushes beyond the limits of postmodern thought. Essential reading for advanced students and academics interested in Twentieth Century Philosophy, Philosophy After Postmodernism will also be of value to scholars working in the fields of Cultural Studies and Sociology.",['Paul Crowther'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JQV_AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=JQV_AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Philosophy+After+Postmodernism:+Civilized+Values+and+the+Scope+of+Knowledge+(Routledge+Studies+in+Twentieth+Century+Philosophy)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2003-09-02,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JQV_AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],

"Japan's Policy Trap: Dollars, Deflation, and the Crisis of Japanese Finance","Until quite recently, the Japanese inspired a kind of puzzled awe. They had pulled themselves together from the ruin of war, built at breakneck speed a formidable array of export champions, and emerged as the world's number-two economy and largest net creditor nation. And they did it by flouting every rule of economic orthodoxy. But today only the puzzlement remains—at Japan's inability to arrest its economic decline, at its festering banking crisis, and at the dithering of its policymakers. Why can't the Japanese government find the political will to fix the country's problems? Japan's Policy Trap offers a provocative new analysis of the country's protracted economic stagnation. Japanese insider Akio Mikuni and long-term Japan resident R. Taggart Murphy contend that the country has landed in a policy trap that defies easy solution. The authors, who have together spent decades at the heart of Japanese finance, expose the deep-rooted political arrangements that have distorted Japan's monetary policy in a deflationary direction. They link Japan's economic difficulties to the Achilles' heel of the U.S. economy: the U.S. trade and current accounts deficits. For the last twenty years, Japan's dollar-denominated trade surplus has outstripped official reserves and currency in circulation. These huge accumulated surpluses have long exercised a growing and perverse influence on monetary policy, forcing Japan's authorities to support a build-up of deflationary dollars. Mikuni and Murphy trace the origins of Japan's policy trap far back into history, in the measures taken by Japan's officials to preserve their economic independence in what they saw as a hostile world. Mobilizing every resource to accumulate precious dollars, the authorities eventually found themselves coping with a hoard they could neither use nor exchange. To counteract the deflationary impact, Japanese authorities resorted to the creation of yen liabilities unrelated to production via the largest financial bubble in history. The bursting of that bubble was followed by massive public works spending that has resulted in an explosion in public sector debt. Japan's Policy Trap points to the likelihood that Japan will run out of ways to support its vast pile of dollar claims. Should the day come when those claims can no longer be supported, the world could see a horrific deflationary spiral in Japan, a crash in the global value of the dollar, or both. The effects would reach far beyond Japan's borders. Mikuni and Murphy suggest that a reduction in Japan's surplus must be accompanied by a reduction in deficits somewhere else—most obviously through far-reaching shifts in the American economy.","['Akio Mikuni', 'R.

Stride toward freedom;: The Montgomery story,"MLK’s classic account of the first successful large-scale act of nonviolent resistance in America: the Montgomery bus boycott. A young Dr. King wrote Stride Toward Freedom just 2 years after the successful completion of the boycott. In his memoir about the event, he tells the stories that informed his radical political thinking before, during, and after the boycott—from first witnessing economic injustice as a teenager and watching his parents experience discrimination to his decision to begin working with the NAACP. Throughout, he demonstrates how activism and leadership can come from any experience at any age. Comprehensive and intimate, Stride Toward Freedom emphasizes the collective nature of the movement and includes King’s experiences learning from other activists working on the boycott, including Mrs. Rosa Parks and Claudette Colvin. It traces the phenomenal journey of a community and shows how the 28-year-old Dr. King, with his conviction for equality and nonviolence, helped transform the nation and the world.

Telling on myself,"What do you do when you have struggled loyally for years beside your husband, living in financial hardship as you bring up your joint children virtually as a single mother, working toward the good times that you can see coming for all of you, only to discover that your husband is committing adultery and is planning to leave you? Worse, he aggressively denies his affair, denouncing you as crazy to your face and to everyone you know, while he schemes to walk off with everything you have worked so hard for as he is reborn into a new life with a star-struck younger woman, as pretty as you once were, who will enjoy everything you have invested in - your financial security, your home-life and even your children. Worse still, he is a notoriously hard-ball lawyer with every intention of crushing you in any way he can, of erasing you from his life, of reducing you to nothing, so that he can move on as if you never existed. Daniel T. Broderick III's relentless harassment of his discarded wife, Betty, made her increasingly crazy as he and his girlfriend - then second wife - Linda Kolkena Broderick piled on the pressure, until one day, on November 5, 1989, at her wits' end and believing herself to be acting in self-defense, she confronted them in the early hours of the morning and in a panic shot them both dead. A multitude of onlookers has absolved Betty for what she did. Many even admire her, especially if they have suffered similar fates to hers. One juror at her trial openly questioned why she had taken so long to kill Dan under such extreme provocation. Now, twenty-five years into a thirty-two year to life prison sentence for her second-degree murder of Dan and Linda Broderick, Betty has reluctantly decided to give her personal account of what led up to that fatal and fateful day, when all three of their futures came violently and abruptly to an end.",['Betty Broderick'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=My86rgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=My86rgEACAAJ&dq=Telling+on+myself&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,CreateSpace,2015-04-03,http://books.google.com/books?id=My86rgEACAAJ&dq=Telling+on+myself&hl=&source=gbs_api,,

Rebel Gold: One Man's Quest to Crack the Code Behind the Secret Treasure of the Confederacy,"As a boy growing up in rural Arkansas, Bob Brewer often heard from his uncle and his great-uncle about a particular tree in the woods, the ""Bible Tree,"" filled with strange carvings. Years later he would learn that this tree was carved with symbols associated with the Knights of the Golden Circle, a Civil War­era secret society that had buried gold coins and other treasure in various remote locations across the South and Southwest in hopes of someday funding a second War Between the States. These secret caches were guarded by sentinels, men whose responsibility it was to watch and protect these sites. To his astonishment, Bob discovered that both his uncle and his great-uncle had been twentieth-century sentinels, and that he had grown up near an important KGC treasure site. In Shadow of the Sentinel, Bob Brewer and investigative journalist Warren Getler tell the fascinating story of the Knights of the Golden Circle and the hidden caches the KGC established across the country. Brewer reveals how, with agonizing effort, he eventually deciphered the fiendishly complicated KGC codes and ciphers, which drew heavily on images associated with Freemasonry. (Many of the key KGC post­Civil War leaders were Scottish Rite Masons, who used the cover of that secret fraternity to conduct their activities.) Using his knowledge of KGC symbolism to crack coded maps, Brewer has located several KGC caches and has recovered gold coins, guns, and other treasure from some of them. Shadow of the Sentinel is the most comprehensive account yet of the activities of the KGC after the Civil War and, indeed, into the 1900s. Getler and Brewer suggest that the clandestine network of KGC operatives was far wider than previously thought, and that it included Jesse James, the former Confederate guerrilla whose stage and bank robberies helped to fill KGC treasure chests. This is a rousing and provocative adventure that weaves together one man's personal quest with an intriguing, little-known chapter in America's hidden history.","['Warren Getler', 'Bob Brewer']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VZByj1_Xs8cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=VZByj1_Xs8cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rebel+Gold:+One+Man%27s+Quest+to+Crack+the+Code+Behind+the+Secret+Treasure+of+the+Confederacy&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2008-06-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VZByj1_Xs8cC&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0

He explains who went to church, who did not attend, how people behaved there, and how they--not merely the clergy--affected how worship was staged. The book provides an accessible account of what happened in the daily and weekly services, and how churches marked the seasons of Christmas, Lent, Easter, and summer. It describes how they celebrated the great events of life: birth, coming of age, and marriage, and gave comfort in sickness and death.

"Avionics Training: Systems, Installation, and Troubleshooting","""AVIONICS TRAINING"" is the first book to respond to new directions in the avionics industry. As electronics spread through every type of aircraft, there is a rising need for technicians who understand ""systems,"" not circuits. Such knowledge is required to identify faulty units aboard the airplane, often during a quick turn time on the ramp. The book explains systems in simple terms, with over 400 full-color photos and drawings. The book assumes no knowledge of electronics, containing neither formulas nor schematics. It describes over 30 systems and how they relate to each other. Confusing acronyms and abbreviations are avoided; they're spelled out on every page. The book deals with two major trends. First, airlines are insisting that mechanics troubleshoot avionics on the flight line. It's becoming too costly for airlines to staff outlying line stations with ""radio mechanics."" Many carriers already require all maintenance people to obtain an FCC license and cross-training in avionics is growing. The second trend is the disappearing ""avionics bench technician."" When today's computerized avionics go bad, they're sent back to the factory because shops can't afford large automatic test stations and software to repair them. The demand today is for people skilled in ""R&R"" (remove and replace)---which requires systems-level knowledge.

American Independent Cinema,"The American independent sector has attracted much attention in recent years, an upsurge of academic work on the subject being accompanied by wider public debate. But many questions remain about how exactly independence should be defined and how its relationship might be understood with other parts of the cinematic landscape, most notably the Hollywood studios. Edited and written by leading authors in the field, American Independent Cinema: indie, indiewood and beyond offers an examination of the field through four sections that range in focus from broad definitions to close focus on particular manifestations of independence. A wide variety of examples are included but within a framework that offers insights into how these are related to one another. More specifically this collection offers: an account of recent developments as well as reviewing, reassessing and revising a number of central positions, approaches and arguments relating to various parts of the independent and/or indie sector. Individual case studies that range from the distinctive qualities of the work of established 'quality' filmmakers such as Wes Anderson, Steven Soderbergh and Rebecca Miller to studies of horror genre production at the more 'disreputable' end of the independent spectrum. Examples of the limits of independence available in some cases within Hollywood, including studies of the work of Stanley Kubrick and Hal Ashby. Case studies of under-researched areas in the margins of American independent cinema, including the Disney nature films and Christian evangelical filmmaking. A number of wider overview chapters that examine contemporary American independent cinema from a number of perspectives. Together, the chapters in the collection offer a unique contribution to the study of independent film in the United States.

Wisdom in Theology (Didsbury Lectures),"In this book respected Old Testament scholar Ronald Clements explores and elucidates a much-debated subject--the place and significance of the Old Testament wisdom writings in Jewish and Christian theology. Based on the Didsbury Lectures delivered by Clements at British Isles Nazarene College in October 1989, 'Wisdom in Theology' first looks at the wisdom tradition in terms of its ancient Near Eastern background, it distinctiveness in Israelite life, and its historical development. Clements then discusses major wisdom themes under various headings: (1) wisdom and the world, (2) wisdom and health, (3) wisdom and politics, (4) wisdom and the household, and (5) wisdom and the divine realm. In explicating the unique role of the wisdom tradition, particularly in post-exilic Israel, Clements shows how wisdom, as opposed to the torah and prophecy, provided the Jews of the dispersion with the basis for a new, noncultic, universalistic worldview. Clements's scholarly discussion demonstrates to modern readers how much is yet to be learned regarding the inheritance of wisdom from the ancient world.",['Ronald Ernest Clements'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L6RLAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=L6RLAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Wisdom+in+Theology+(Didsbury+Lectures)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2006-08-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=L6RLAwAAQBAJ&dq=Wisdom+in+Theology+(Didsbury+Lectures)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

"The Clinical Practice of Complementary, Alternative, and Western Medicine","""Western Medicine"", ""Alternative Medicine"", ""Complementary Medicine"", ""Holistic Medicine"", and ""Natural Medicine."" There is really only one ""medicine"" that heals and puts the whole patient, not the disease, at the center of care: Integrated Medicine. This practice integrates all modalities of healing to produce not merely a medical cure, but a deeper healing of the patient on his or her own terms. The Clinical Practice of Complementary, Alternative, and Western Medicine is a scientifically based text that informs and leads the practitioner easily through the maze of alternative therapies. Unlike other books that address the different alternative modalities, this text integrates homeopathy, acupuncture, chinese herbology, western herbology, and clinical nutrition, then combines them with traditional medicine. The author explains the new paradigm of patient-centered and Integrated Medicine and includes an extensive section on the physical underpinnings of this new paradigm, a paradigm that employs thermodynamics, non linear dynamics, chaos theory, and fractal geometry in an easy to understand discourse. The book incorporates the author's fundamental training in the alternative modalities and his ten years of clinical practice, a practice in which multiple integrated modalities of healing were utilized in the healing of over 10,000 patients. The Clinical Practice of Complementary, Alternative, and Western Medicine is a tremendously valuable reference for practitioners who want to learn about and practice alternative therapies and those who want to be more informed about what their patients may be doing and taking, and the influences those self-administered therapies may be having on their care.",['W.

The Orchid Thief,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK A modern classic of personal journalism, The Orchid Thief is Susan Orlean’s wickedly funny, elegant, and captivating tale of an amazing obsession. Determined to clone an endangered flower—the rare ghost orchid Polyrrhiza lindenii—a deeply eccentric and oddly attractive man named John Laroche leads Orlean on an unforgettable tour of America’s strange flower-selling subculture, through Florida’s swamps and beyond, along with the Seminoles who help him and the forces of justice who fight him. In the end, Orlean—and the reader—will have more respect for underdog determination and a powerful new definition of passion. In this new edition, coming fifteen years after its initial publication and twenty years after she first met the “orchid thief,” Orlean revisits this unforgettable world, and the route by which it was brought to the screen in the film Adaptation, in a new retrospective essay. Look for special features inside. Join the Random House Reader’s Circle for author chats and more.

New Thought: A Practical American Spirituality,"This book introduces New Thought, a more-than-a-century-old movement dedicated to the healing of body, pocketbook, and interpersonal relationships through persistent positive thinking and the acceptance of one's indwelling divinity. New Thought applies religious beliefs to solve the problems of daily living. Based largely on teachings from the Bible, it also incorporates Eastern wisdom and psychological principles. It is practical, spiritual, and distinctly American. The authors provide historical background, philosophical perspective, and new understanding. New Thought fulfills the contemporary hunger for a spirituality that promotes both the practice of the presence of God and health, wealth, and happiness here and now. This book is for everyone who wants to go deeper than most popular writing on spirituality and self-improvement, much of which is indebted to New Thought. New Thought still is evolving; it may yet be the point at which religion, philosophy, and science come together as the most effective combination to move the world to greater peace, plenty, health, and harmony. Whether you accept New Thought or reject it, it is important to learn more about what New Thought is, where it came from, how it is evolving, and how to use it, if you wish. These topics are what this book is about.","['C. Alan Anderson', 'Deborah G.

Fotheringham's Sporting Trivia: The Greatest Sports Trivia Book Ever,"'Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness and disregard of all the rules' George Orwell 'The public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything except what is worth knowing' Oscar Wilde Will Fotheringham scoured the globe for this tsunami of trivia drawn from every sport known to humankind, and a few more besides. Subjects include how to conduct a bullfight, Hollywood's badminton range in the 1930s the holes of St. Andrew's golf course, why the Olympic flag has five rings, and much more. Fotheringham's Sporting Trivia contains more fun facts than anyone should be allowed to know. For example, did you know that the origins of loveo ( no scoreo) in tennis is thought to have come from the French word l'oeufo meaning eggo which is the same shape as the oval zero? And where does the Nike swoosho logo come from? Well, it was devised by University of Oregon student Carolyn Davidsons in 1964.

America's Other Jesus,"The Story of the Transformation of Jesus from Divinity to Celebrity The United States (it is often pointed out) is one of the most religious countries on earth, and most Americans belong to one Christian church or another. But as Stephen Prothero argues in American Jesus, many of the most interesting appraisals of Jesus have emerged outside the churches: in music, film, and popular culture; and among Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and people of no religion at all. Popular revisions of Jesus are nothing new: Thomas Jefferson famously took scissors to the New Testament to produce a Jesus he could call his own. In Prothero's incisive chronicle, the emergence of a cult of Jesus--as folk hero and commercial icon--is America's most distinctive contribution to Western religion. Prothero describes how Jesus was enlisted by abolitionists and Klansmen, by Teddy Roosevelt and Marcus Garvey. He explains how, in our own time, the proliferation of Jesus' image on Broadway stages and bumper stickers, on the cover of Time and on the Internet, in a Holy Land theme park and on a hot-air balloon, expresses the strange mix of the secular and the sacred in contemporary America. American Jesus is a lively and often witty work of history. As an account of the ways Americans have cast the carpenter from Nazareth in their own image, it is also an examination, through the looking glass, of the American character.",['Stephen Prothero'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GHQANI6ARZMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=GHQANI6ARZMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=America%27s+Other+Jesus&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2004-09-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GHQANI6ARZMC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],3.0

Silent Proof,"The man of her fantasies is finally hers. Sort of… Two things haunt forensic anthropologist Hazel MacLeod: the bones of victims of genocide she examines for her work, and former SEAL Sean Logan’s rejection. But within days of moving to her cousin’s estate to take a much needed break, she finds herself faced with both. First, she’s called in to examine a mass grave in Virginia, then, her politician cousin receives a threatening letter and insists Hazel needs around the clock protection—from none other than Sean Logan. To make matters worse, because the threat to her is classified, Hazel and Sean must pretend to be lovers to hide that he’s her bodyguard. Sean has spent years trying to avoid his boss’s sexy cousin, but now he’s guarding her twenty-four/seven and even bringing her as his date to a romantic destination wedding. As the heat between them intensifies, Sean can’t lose sight of the danger that brought them together. But when bullets start flying, new questions arise. Are the senator’s political rivals really behind the threat, or is someone trying to silence Hazel from speaking for the dead?

A Tidewater Morning: Three Tales from Youth,"From the #1 New York Times–bestselling author of Sophie’s Choice: three novellas of a young writer’s journey to adulthood. In Love Day, twenty-year-old Paul Whitehurst is a Marine lieutenant during World War II, waiting to land on Okinawa, wrestling with anxiety and memories of his boyhood in Virginia. In Shadrach, ten-year-old Paul witnesses his neighbors as they welcome a guest: a ninety-nine-year-old former slave who has walked nine hundred miles from Alabama so that he may die on the land of his childhood owner. And in A Tidewater Morning, Paul is thirteen and struggling to deal with his mother’s impending death from cancer. Together in one volume, each of these affecting semiautobiographical novellas from the author of such literary classics as the Pulitzer Prize–winning The Confessions of Nat Turner and the memoir Darkness Visible, weaves together the transformative experiences of Whitehurst’s early life with William Styron’s signature deep historical insight, underscoring how the significance of the past informs the present. As the Los Angeles Times notes, it is “one of Styron’s finest works. . . . The beauty and humanity of the Southern tradition are evoked vividly.” This ebook features a new illustrated biography of William Styron, including original letters, rare photos, and never-before-seen documents from the Styron family and the Duke University Archives.",['William Styron'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ye-7LGNjBDIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ye-7LGNjBDIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Tidewater+Morning:+Three+Tales+from+Youth&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2010-05-04,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ye-7LGNjBDIC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],6.0

"Panzer Operations: The Eastern Front Memoir of General Raus, 1941-1945","German general Erhard Raus was one of the most talented commanders to fight on the Eastern Front in Russia, where he was eventually appointed to army group command in early 1945. By the time the war ended, Raus had established a reputation as one of the German army's foremost tacticians of armored warfare, which made him a prized capture by U.S. Army intelligence. In American captivity, Raus wrote a detailed memoir of his service in Russia. His battlefield experience and keen tactical eye makes his memoir especially valuable.The Raus memoir-now translated, compiled, and edited by prominent World War II historian Steven H. Newton-covers the Russian campaign from the first day of the war to his being relieved of his command at Hitler's order in the spring of 1945. It includes a detailed examination of Raus's 6th Panzer Division's drive to Leningrad, his experiences in the Soviet winter counteroffensive around Moscow, the unsuccessful attempt to relieve Stalingrad and the final desperate battles inside Germany at the end of the war.","['Erhard Raus', 'Steven H.

The Penobscot Conspiracy,"During the fall of 1779, the spark of freedom is at its lowest ebb. The fledgling county is so weary of war that a majority of Americans are almost ready to accept a peace that would comprise the Declaration of Independence. In a last-ditch attempt to keep the freedom fires burning, America sends her fleet to attack a British fort on the Penobscot Bay in eastern Maine. Though the Americans possess a superior force, the mission inexplicably ends in total defeat -- a disaster cloaked in conspiracy as infamous as Pearl Harbor. What follows is a court martial hearing that threatens to tear the fragile nation apart.

The Spider #85 : The Council Of Evil,"Who was Jeffrey Epstein? A Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist unearths never-before-reported details in the most comprehensive account yet of the disgraced financier's life, death, and criminal web, including the role of Ghislaine Maxwell. An ID Book Club Selection By now, the basic contours of Jeffrey Epstein's horrendous crimes--his decades-long serial abuse of young women and underage girls--are familiar. But for all that has been written about Epstein since his shocking death in a lower Manhattan jail cell, an astonishing amount remains unknown. A shy Brooklyn kid turned renegade financier, Jeffrey Epstein never wanted to play by the rules of polite society. He was elusive in life and he has remained just as elusive in death. What is known is that he had amassed nearly $600 million by the time of his death. That fortune allowed Epstein to pursue a privileged, secretive life, jetting between his fortress-like homes in Manhattan, New Mexico, and Little St. James, his private island. Behind these closed doors, Epstein socialized with scientists and world leaders and preyed on powerless young women. In The Spider, Barry Levine shines a light into the darkest corners of Epstein's world, including - Epstein's young adulthood and earliest accusations of sexual misconduct - the murky sources of Epstein's fortune and business dealings - Epstein's circle of confidantes and employees, particularly the nature of his long relationship with socialite Ghislaine Maxwell - his ties to powerful men, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Les Wexner, and Donald Trump - Epstein's last hours as a free man in Paris and the secret operation to arrest him at a New Jersey airport before he could flee - new details on Epstein's final days in jail and the mystery surrounding his death Featuring rare and never-before-seen photographs, The Spider exposes how Epstein operated and evaded justice for so long--and how he drew so many others into his criminal web.",['Barry Levine'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fU8EEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fU8EEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Spider&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crown,2020-10,http://books.google.com/books?id=fU8EEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Spider&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],1.0

Where better to repair those severed ties than on a girls' getaway to the beautiful paradise of Tulum, Mexico?

When Ashley disappears on their girls' night out, Natalie and Lauren have to try to piece together their hazy memories to figure out what could have happened to her, while also reconciling their feelings of guilt over their last moments together.

"In Search of Lost Time, Vol. 3: The Guermantes Way","An authoritative new edition of the third volume in Marcel Proust's epic masterwork, In Search of Lost Time Marcel Proust's monumental seven-part novel In Search of Lost Time is considered by many to be the greatest novel of the twentieth century. This edition of volume three, The Guermantes Way, is edited and annotated by noted Proust scholar William C. Carter, who endeavors to bring the classic C. K. Scott Moncrieff translation closer to the spirit and style of the author's original text. Continuing the story begun in Swann's Way and continued in In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower, The Guermantes Way follows Proust's young protagonist as he advances through aristocratic French society in late-nineteenth-century Paris. A departure from the intimacy of the sprawling novel's previous two installments, part three unfolds against a colorful backdrop of Parisian life, moving from literary salon to opulent social gathering to provide a biting and satirical commentary on culture, human foibles, the ways of the world, and the irretrievable loss of time.",['Marcel Proust'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9zRxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=9zRxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=In+Search+of+Lost+Time,+Vol.+3:+The+Guermantes+Way&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Yale University Press,2018-01-01,"http://books.google.com/books?id=9zRxDwAAQBAJ&dq=In+Search+of+Lost+Time,+Vol.+3:+The+Guermantes+Way&hl=&source=gbs_api",['France'],

The War at Home: The Domestic Costs of Bush's Militarism,"While numerous analysts have discussed, and decried, the geopolitical ambitions of the Bush administration and its neoconservative allies, the attention to America's imperial posture overseas has turned eyes away from a crucial dimension of belligerent foreign policy: the domestic politics of war. Frances Fox Piven, one of the most celebrated US social scientists, raises questions others have not. She examines the ways the War on Terror served to reinforce the Bush administration's political base and analyzes the manner in which flag-waving politicians used the emotional fog of war to further their regressive social and economic agendas. Always in the past, US governments that made war sooner or later tried to reward their peoples for the blood and wealth they were forced to sacrifice. During World War II, tax rates on the wealthy rose to 90 percent; toward the end of the Vietnam War, 18-year-olds were given the right to vote.",['Frances Fox Piven'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X8GeGwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=X8GeGwAACAAJ&dq=The+War+at+Home:+The+Domestic+Costs+of+Bush%27s+Militarism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2006-06-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=X8GeGwAACAAJ&dq=The+War+at+Home:+The+Domestic+Costs+of+Bush%27s+Militarism&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],

The Elysium Commission,"L.E. Modesitt returns to SF with a whole new future world on the brink of destruction. A brilliant scientist on the planet Devanta has created a small universe contiguous to ours --and a utopian city on one of the planets. The question becomes, though, an utopia for whom? And why is a shady entertainment mogul subsidizing the scientist? More critical than that, does this new universe require the destruction of a portion --or all -- of our universe in order to grow and stabilize? Blaine Donne is a retired military special operative now devoted to problem-solving for hire. He investigates a series of seemingly unrelated mysteries that arise with the arrival of a woman with unlimited resources who has neither a present nor a past. The more he investigates, the more questions arise, including the role of the two heiresses who are more -- and less -- than they seem, and the more Donne is pushed inexorably toward an explosive solution and a regional interstellar war.

Nonsense!,"""An illuminating look at the surprising upside of ambiguity--and how, properly harnessed, it can inspire learning, creativity, even empathy Life today feels more overwhelming and chaotic than ever. We face constant political and economic upheaval, and we're bombarded with information, much of it contradictory. Managing uncertainty--in our jobs, our relationships, and our everyday lives--is fast becoming an essential skill. What should we do when we have no idea what to do? In Nonsense, Jamie Holmes shows how we react to ambiguous situations and how we can do it better. Being confused is unpleasant, so we tend to shutter our minds as we grasp for meaning and stability, especially in stressful circumstances. We're hard-wired to resolve contradictions quickly and extinguish anomalies. But in doing so, we lose a vital opportunity to learn something new, solve a hard problem, or see the world from another perspective. Over the last few years, new insights from social psychology and cognitive science have deepened our understanding of the role of ambiguity in our lives and Holmes brings this research together for the first time, showing how we can use uncertainty to our advantage. Whether we're dealing with an unclear medical diagnosis or launching a risky new product, Nonsense promises to transform the way we conduct business, educate our children, and make decisions. In an increasingly unpredictable, complex world, it turns out that what matters most isn't IQ, willpower, or confidence in what we know. It's how we deal with what we don't understand""--",['Jamie Holmes'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xQkIDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xQkIDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nonsense!&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Broadway Books,2015,http://books.google.com/books?id=xQkIDQAAQBAJ&dq=Nonsense!&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],26.0

From Cold War to Hot Peace: UN Interventions 1946-1994,"How peace has been made and maintained, experienced and imagined is not only a matter of historical interest, but also of pressing concern. Peace: A World History is the first study to explore the full spectrum of peace and peacemaking from prehistoric to contemporary times in a single volume aimed at improving their prospects. By focusing on key periods, events, people, ideas and texts, Antony Adolf shows how the inspiring possibilities and pragmatic limits of peace and peacemaking were shaped by their cultural contexts and, in turn, shaped local and global histories. Diplomatic, pacifist, legal, transformative non-violent and anti-war movements are just a few prominent examples. Proposed and performed in socio-economic, political, religious, philosophical and other ways, Adolf's presentation of the diversity of peace and peacemaking challenges the notions that peace is solely the absence of war, that this negation is the only task of peacemakers, and that history is exclusively written by military victors. “Without the victories of peacemakers and the resourcefulness of the peaceful,” he contends, “there would be no history to write.” This book is essential reading for students, scholars, policy-shapers, activists and general readers involved with how present forms of peace and peacemaking have been influenced by those of the past, and how future forms can benefit by taking these into account.",['Antony Adolf'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J1kh_7BmkoMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=J1kh_7BmkoMC&pg=PT259&dq=From+Cold+War+to+Hot+Peace:+UN+Interventions+1946-1994&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,John Wiley & Sons,2013-05-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J1kh_7BmkoMC&source=gbs_api,['History'],

No one alive remembers that first horrific onslaught and no one believes in its return—except for the dragonriders.

Embracing Fear: How to Turn What Scares Us into Our Greatest Gift,"It′s Time to Take Back Your Life Fear takes many forms -- dread, panic, anxiety, self-consciousness, superstition, and negativity -- and manifests itself in many ways -- avoidance, procrastination, judgment, control, and agitation, to name just a few. Whether we are afraid of the dark or being alone, of failure or commitment, of public speaking or flying, fear dominates our lives, affecting nearly every decision we make. Combining compelling stories from the author′s twenty-five-year practice, examples from his own struggles with addiction and depression, and practical exercises and tools, Embracing Fear does not pretend to teach the impossible and eliminate fear, but rather shows us that once we understand it we can live beyond its tyrannical control. Instead of repressing or ignoring the voices of panic and dread, we learn that it is only through facing, exploring, accepting, and responding to fear that we free ourselves from its paralyzing grip.",['Thom Rutledge'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PuWfDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PuWfDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Embracing+Fear:+How+to+Turn+What+Scares+Us+into+Our+Greatest+Gift&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Zondervan,2009-10-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PuWfDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Self-Help'],

"What! Me Travel?: How to Save Time, Energy, and the Big Bucks","""What! Me Travel?"" is the premier ""HOW TO TRAVEL"" guide dedicated to helping mankind save time, energy, sanity and even the big bucks, while spinning the travel wheel of fortune. The book contains clear instruction, Internet sites, and anecdotal perspective, allowing the reader ample direction to reveal a successful vacation strategy. TravelDan peels back the onion layers of travel to explain compulsory subjects with a fun twist. Over 145 million people in the United States took a trip or vacation last year, with nationwide sales of travel related books peaking to an all-time record of $765 million dollars. The travel section in most bookstores is littered with every specific topic one can imagine, with one exception. ""What!"" Me Travel?"" is based on TravelDan's extensive experience in the travel industry (lecturing, consulting, writing and interviews in both television, and radio).

Rogue Herries,"Described on its first publication by John Buchan as the finest English novel since Jude the Obscure, Rogue Herries tells the story of the larger than life Francis Herries who uproots his family from Yorkshire and brings them to live in Borrowdale where their life is as dramatic as the landscape surrounding them. Proud, violent and impetuous he despises his first wife, sells his mistress at a county fair and forms a great love for the teenage gypsy Mirabell Starr. Alongside this turbulent story, runs that of his son David, with enemies of his own, and that of his gentle daughter Deborah with placid dreams that will not be realised in her father's house.

Live Simply in the City,"Burned-out after years of doing development work around the world, William Powers spent a season in a 12-foot-by-12-foot cabin off the grid in North Carolina, as recounted in his award-winning memoir Twelve by Twelve. Could he live a similarly minimalist life in the heart of New York City? To find out, Powers and his wife jettisoned 80 percent of their stuff, left their 2,000-square-foot Queens townhouse, and moved into a 350-square-foot “micro-apartment” in Greenwich Village. Downshifting to a two-day workweek, Powers explores the viability of Slow Food and Slow Money, technology fasts and urban sanctuaries.

Islam and Capitalism,"Early Islam and the Birth of Capitalism proposes a strikingly original thesis; that capitalism first emerged in Arabia, not in late medieval Italian city states as is commonly assumed. Early Islam made a seminal but largely unrecognized contribution to the history of economic thought: it is the only religion founded by an entrepreneur. Descending from an elite dynasty of religious, civil and commercial leaders, Muhammad was a successful businessman before founding Islam. As such, the new religion had much to say on trade, consumer protection, business ethics and property. As Islam rapidly spread across the region so did the economic teachings of early Islam, which eventually made their way to Europe. Early Islam and the Birth of Capitalism demonstrates how Islamic institutions and business practices were adopted and adapted in Venice and Genoa.These financial innovations include the invention of the corporation, business management techniques, commercial arithmetic, and monetary reform. There were other Islamic institutions assimilated in Europe: charities, the waqf, inspired trusts, and institutions of higher learning, the madrasas, were models for the oldest colleges of Oxford and Cambridge. As such it can be rightfully said that these essential aspects of capitalist thought all have Islamic antecedents.""",['Benedikt Koehler'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rgc5rgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Rgc5rgEACAAJ&dq=Islam+and+Capitalism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2015-06-15,http://books.google.com/books?id=Rgc5rgEACAAJ&dq=Islam+and+Capitalism&hl=&source=gbs_api,,

Flying Free,"The daughter of a Chilean father and a Filipina mother, Cecilia Rodriguez Aragon grew up as a shy, timid child in a small midwestern town during the 1960s. Targeted by school bullies and dismissed by many of her teachers, she worried that people would find out the truth: that she was INTF. Incompetent. Nerd. Terrified. Failure. This feeling stayed with her well into her twenties when she was told that “girls can’t do science” or “women just don’t know how to handle machines.” Yet in the span of just six years, Cecilia became the first Latina pilot to secure a place on the United States Unlimited Aerobatic Team and earn the right to represent her country at the Olympics of aviation, the World Aerobatic Championships. How did she do it? Using mathematical techniques to overcome her fear, Cecilia performed at air shows in front of millions of people. She jumped out of airplanes and taught others how to fly. She learned how to fund-raise and earn money to compete at the world level. She worked as a test pilot and contributed to the design of experimental airplanes, crafting curves of metal and fabric that shaped air to lift inanimate objects high above the earth. And best of all, she surprised everyone by overcoming the prejudices people held about her because of her race and her gender. Flying Free is the story of how Cecilia Aragon broke free from expectations and rose above her own limits by combining her passion for flying with math and logic in unexpected ways. You don’t have to be a math whiz or a science geek to learn from her story. You just have to want to soar.",['Cecilia Aragon'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=50vLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=50vLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Flying+Free&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Blackstone Publishing,2020-09-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=50vLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Bidding Precisely Volume 2,"The second edition of this book incorporates the 2/1 Game Force bidding system. The book is designed to improve your bidding in 5 steps. The 1st step involves maximizing your use of the 2/1 system whenever you open with a major suit. The 2nd step involves your use of the New Minor Forcing convention to find a 5-card major in responder’s hand. The 3rd step involves adoption of the strong 2 bid, a bid of 20-21p with an unbalanced hand (one with a singleton or void). By tweaking reverses, this allows the opener to show an unbalanced hand by bidding at the 2-lelvel with 16-17p or at the 3-level with 18-19p. The 4th step involves optimizing your slam bidding with conventions to show the trump Queen. It also involves the use of the Redwood kickback convention minor suit contracts and the use of the Fourth Suit Forcing convention to ascertain whether the opener has 4or 5 cards in this 2nd bid suit. The 5th step involves the use of bids to hamper the opponents from finding their 4-4 spade fit.

"Lugosi: His Life in Films, on Stage, and in the Hearts of Horror Lovers","He was born Béla Ferenc Dezso Blasko on October 20, 1882, in Hungary. He joined Budapest’s National Theater in 1913 and later appeared in several Hungarian films under the pseudonym Arisztid Olt. After World War I, he helped the Communist regime nationalize Hungary’s film industry, but barely escaped arrest when the government was deposed, fleeing to the United States in 1920. As he became a star in American horror films in the 1930s and 1940s, publicists and fan magazines crafted outlandish stories to create a new history for Lugosi. The cinema’s Dracula was transformed into one of Hollywood’s most mysterious actors.

Disrupted Lives: How People Create Meaning in a Chaotic World,"Our lives are full of disruptions, from the minor—a flat tire, an unexpected phone call—to the fateful—a diagnosis of infertility, an illness, the death of a loved one. In the first book to examine disruption in American life from a cultural rather than a psychological perspective, Gay Becker follows hundreds of people to find out what they do after something unexpected occurs. Starting with bodily distress, she shows how individuals recount experiences of disruption metaphorically, drawing on important cultural themes to help them reestablish order and continuity in their lives. Through vivid and poignant stories of people from different walks of life who experience different types of disruptions, Becker examines how people rework their ideas about themselves and their worlds, from the meaning of disruption to the meaning of life itself. Becker maintains that to understand disruption, we must also understand cultural definitions of normalcy. She questions what is normal for a family, for health, for womanhood and manhood, and for growing older. In the United States, where life is expected to be orderly and predictable, disruptions are particularly unsettling, she contends. And, while continuity in life is an illusion, it is an effective one because it organizes people's plans and expectations. Becker's phenomenological approach yields a rich, compelling, and entirely original narrative. Disrupted Lives acknowledges the central place of discontinuity in our existence at the same time as it breaks new ground in understanding the cultural dynamics that underpin life in the United States. FROM THE BOOK:""The doctor was blunt. He does not mince words. He did a [semen] analysis and he came back and said, 'This is devastatingly poor.' I didn't expect to hear that. It had never occurred to me. It was such a shock to my sense of self and to all these preconceptions of my manliness and virility and all of that. That was a very, very devastating moment and I was dumbfounded. . . .

A Rage To Live,"Richard Burton was a brilliant, charismatic man - a unique blend of erudite scholar and daring adventurer. Fluent in twenty-nine languages, he found it easy to pass himself off as a native, thereby gaining unique insight into societies otherwise closed to Western scrutiny. He followed service as an intelligence officer in India by a daring penetration of the sacred Islamic cities of Mecca and Medina disguised as a pilgrim. He was the first European to enter the forbidden African city of Harar, and discovered Lake Tanganyika in his search for the source of the Nile. His fascination with, and research into, the intimate customs of ethnic races (which would eventually culminate in his brilliant Kama Sutra) earned him a racy reputation in that age of sexual repression. Little surprise, then, that Isabel Arundell's aristocratic mother objected to her daughter's marriage to this most notorious of figures. Isabel, however, was a spirited, independent-minded woman and was also deeply, passionately in love with Richard. Against all expectations but their own, the Burtons enjoyed a remarkably successful marriage.",['Mary S.

Harpoon,"A revelatory account of the cloak-and-dagger Israeli campaign to target the finances fueling terror organizations--an effort that became the blueprint for U.S. efforts to combat threats like ISIS and drug cartels. ISIS boasted $2.4 billion of revenue in 2015, yet for too long the global war on terror overlooked financial warfare as an offensive strategy. ""Harpoon,"" the creation of Mossad legend Meir Dagan, directed spies, soldiers, and attorneys to disrupt and destroy money pipelines and financial institutions that paid for the bloodshed perpetrated by Hamas, Hezbollah, and other groups. Written by an attorney who worked with Harpoon and a bestselling journalist, Harpoon offers a gripping story of the Israeli-led effort, now joined by the Americans, to choke off the terrorists' oxygen supply, money, via unconventional warfare.","['Nitsana Darshan-Leitner', 'Samuel M.

All Our Tomorrows,"This is the 44th volume in the Occasional Paper series of the United States Air Force Institute for National Security Studies (INSS). This report summarizes a three-phase research project undertaken by the USAF Institute for National Security Studies on behalf of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to forecast long-range global trends affecting arms control technologies. The report projects the international political, economic, and scientific environments to the year 2015. It posits economic and technological drivers as shaping the system, including its military and political dimensions. The result will be a two-tiered system, with great danger arising from significant proliferation in the second tier and the transition zone between tiers. The report next draws conclusions from this likely future for the scope, value, and practice of arms control. Arms control will be focused less on limitation and reduction of existing weapons, although the endgame between the United States and Russia will remain a significant effort. The focus will shift to the less well-defined realm of counterproliferation, and to marginal, failing, and failed states as well as nontraditional and non-state actors. New dimensions will be added, including control efforts toward small arms, advanced conventional weapons, military space, and information operations. The report then extrapolates from this future to assess the likely arms control technology requirements in cooperative, noncooperative, intrusive, and nonintrusive regimes. The projection here is continuing requirements for each of these specialized sets of technologies, with particular emphasis on multiple-use technologies for remote arms control compliance and verification monitoring as well as for intelligence detection and collection.",['James M.

Digital Power Electronics and Applications,"The purpose of this book is to describe the theory of Digital Power Electronics and its applications. The authors apply digital control theory to power electronics in a manner thoroughly different from the traditional, analog control scheme. In order to apply digital control theory to power electronics, the authors define a number of new parameters, including the energy factor, pumping energy, stored energy, time constant, and damping time constant. These parameters differ from traditional parameters such as the power factor, power transfer efficiency, ripple factor, and total harmonic distortion. These new parameters result in the definition of new mathematical modeling: • A zero-order-hold (ZOH) is used to simulate all AC/DC rectifiers. • A first-order-hold (FOH) is used to simulate all DC/AC inverters. • A second-order-hold (SOH) is used to simulate all DC/DC converters. • A first-order-hold (FOH) is used to simulate all AC/AC (AC/DC/AC) converters. * Presents most up-to-date methods of analysis and control algorithms for developing power electronic converters and power switching circuits * Provides an invaluable reference for engineers designing power converters, commercial power supplies, control systems for motor drives, active filters, etc. * Presents methods of analysis not available in other books.","['Fang Lin Luo', 'Hong Ye', 'Muhammad H.

Zij die bang zijn om iets te durven kunnen net zo goed verder gaan. Het zal de luie mensen moe maken, omdat het vraagt om onmiddellijke actie. Het zal de verfijnde mensen vervelen en de sceptici vermaken. Het zal anderen irriteren. Sommigen zullen nooit weten waar het allemaal over gaat. Het zal niet erg populair worden, omdat het vraagt om moed, snelheid en durf. Maar in de ogen van jou, een van de weinigen, zal een glans van strijdlust komen als jij dit boek leest.

The Messenger Boy Murders,"THE INTERPRETATION OF MURDER is an inventive tour de force inspired by Sigmund Freud's 1909 visit to America, accompanied by protégé and rival Carl Jung. When a wealthy young debutante is discovered bound, whipped and strangled in a luxurious apartment overlooking the city, and another society beauty narrowly escapes the same fate, the mayor of New York calls upon Freud to use his revolutionary new ideas to help the surviving victim recover her memory of the attack, and solve the crime. But nothing about the attacks - or about the surviving victim, Nora - is quite as it seems. And there are those in very high places determined to stop the truth coming out, and Freud's startling theories taking root on American soil.",['Jed Rubenfeld'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=52HMFETR0dYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=52HMFETR0dYC&pg=PT177&dq=The+Messenger+Boy+Murders&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hachette UK,2008-04-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=52HMFETR0dYC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],41.0

A Nightmare On Elm Street #2: Dreamspawn,"Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the most inventive American films of the 1980s. Its sleeper success bred a series of film sequels and a syndicated television program while its villain, Freddy Krueger, became a Hollywood horror icon for the ages. In the four decades since its release, Craven's creation and subsequent franchise has become firmly established as a pop culture institution and a celebrated symbol of American cinema. This book takes readers on an engrossing journey through the history, production and themes of the Nightmare on Elm Street film series and its spin-off TV show, Freddy's Nightmares. It reveals new stories about the franchise's history and dives into some of the themes and ideas that tend to be overlooked. The book has a foreword by production designer Mick Strawn and exclusive interviews with cast and crew, including legendary Freddy Krueger actor Robert Englund; directors Jack Sholder, Chuck Russell, Mick Garris, Tom McLoughlin, Lisa Gottlieb, and William Malone; cinematographers Jacques Haitkin, Roy H.

Democracy and the organization of political parties,"Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties, originally published in 1902, represented the first serious attempt to analyze the consequences of democratic suffrage by a comparative analysis of political systems. As such, Ostrogorski's two-volume study of the party system in Britain and the United States exerted profound influence on the subsequent writings of Max Weber and Robert Michels. A descriptive analyst of the party system in these two countries, Ostrogorski developed concepts and methods that an-ticipated by nearly half a century those later used by American and British political scientists. The core of Ostrogorski's analysis is a detailed history of the rise of and changes within the party system in Britain and the United States, the first nations to introduce mass suffrage. While the emphasis of Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties is on the similar trends in the political parties of both countries, Ostrogorski also showed concern with the sources of differences between them. Seeking to explain these variations, he suggested a number of fundamental hypotheses about these two societies that con-tinue to be of relevance today. Lipset's substantial introduction places Os-trogorski's work within its historical context and assesses Ostrogorski's im-pact and influence on both his contemporaries and on later political scien-tists.",['Moisei Ostrogorski'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dPdKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=dPdKDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Democracy+and+the+organization+of+political+parties&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2018-02-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dPdKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],

The Autobiography of Jesus,"It's not what you think. Unless you think everything is wrong. Imagine if Kurt Vonnegut and Hunter Thompson collaborated on a new version of The Bible, and you kinda get the gist. The Autobiography of Jesus X is not for the faint of heart! Here is the prophet: a cynical, dreadlocked pothead crackpot who's done all sorts of despicable things. For which He wonders if forgiveness is possible. Because now he is a only a ghost of the God he once was - now retired. After this one incarnation as a human being on Earth, he quit. As God, he had become indifferent. But as a tall black Jew with blue eyes and red hair in the Roman Empire, he proved to be too smart for his own good. Or maybe just too human. He tried to quit. The Autobiography of Jesus X is either the new Bible or the most offensive book ever written, or both. Maybe neither. This is part sci-fi/fantasy, part expose memoir, and part stand-up comedy. He pretty much frames it as His last message to humanity. So we might want to listen. Or read.

Chicago Aviation: An Illustrated History,"From the dawn of flight, Chicago has played a vital role in the development of aviation. Favored by geography and a superb network of railroads, the Windy City rapidly became the nation's crossroad. Young's richly illustrated history portrays the inventors, entrepreneurs, and aviators who conquered the skies and made Chicago the nation's premier hub for air travel and transport. Aviation's colorful figures come to life as Young recounts tales of the pilots, patrons, and passengers who sparked public interest in the early days of flight. Beginning with Chicago's first aviation event--a balloon ascension on July 4, 1855--Young traces the local personalities and technologies that helped make the dream of flight a reality. He offers the most complete account to date of pioneer Chicago aviator Octave Chanute, whose series of daring glider experiments led to international attention and a friendship with the Wright brothers, who sought his advice before their landmark flight at Kitty Hawk. The Windy City's golden age of aviation began in 1910, when a group of wealthy flying enthusiasts formed the Aero Club of Illinois. Fascinated audiences flocked to see the club's spectacular aviation shows and to visit Cicero Field, the place where many of America's first aviators learned to fly. Prominent public figures of the day included Harold McCormick, the millionaire patron of early aviation; Charles ""Pop"" Dickinson, who gained fame as the nation's oldest pilot; and Katherine Stinson, who at Cicero Field became the first woman to perform the loop-the-loop maneuver. Dozens of devastating air crashes over the years fueled America's early fear of flying. Chicago witnessed its share of air tragedies, from the Wingfoot blimp disaster of 1919 that caused the city to consider a ban on flying over its borders to the 1979 crash of a DC-10 jumbo jet at O'Hare that helped doom the career of that airplane. As Young investigates these crashes--as well as the mysterious legend of the ""Great Lakes Triangle""--he sheds light on the evolution of airline safety. Aviation progress in a major city inevitably involves the continuous, often contentious, campaign for bigger and better airports. Young analyzes Midway's birth, death, and rebirth as well as the city's decision in the late 1960s to build a new runway at O'Hare, which caused a political furor over noise in the suburbs. At the end of the twentieth century, statewide controversy erupted again over the decision to reconfigure O'Hare, renewing the debate over airport expansion. Engagingly written and strikingly illustrated, Chicago Aviation is the only comprehensive history of the city's crucial contributions to the first century of powered flight.",['David Young'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=56WFQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=56WFQgAACAAJ&dq=Chicago+Aviation:+An+Illustrated+History&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2003,http://books.google.nl/books?id=56WFQgAACAAJ&dq=Chicago+Aviation:+An+Illustrated+History&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

"Legal Feminism: Activism, Lawyering, and Legal Theory","In the late 1970s, feminist scholars and activists joined together to build a movement aimed at bringing feminist theory and experiences to the practice and teaching of American law. Since then, the feminist jurisprudence movement has taken root, with courts and legislatures addressing matters of sex and gender inequality, and law schools employing feminist and post-feminist theory in the classroom. In this book, Ann Scales, a founding contributor to the movement, reflects on the past, present, and future of feminist jurisprudence. Part personal memoir, part primer, and part treatise, Legal Feminism is a de-jargonized account of how feminist jurisprudence can solve traditional legal conflicts, and why it matters to anyone committed to building an equitable and progressive society.",['Ann Scales'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XLF6_q21oE8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XLF6_q21oE8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Legal+Feminism:+Activism,+Lawyering,+and+Legal+Theory&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",NYU Press,2006-05-19,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XLF6_q21oE8C&dq=Legal+Feminism:+Activism,+Lawyering,+and+Legal+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Law'],

The devastating failure of his formula for success further compounds his inner fears and doubts.

Lost languages,"Most of the 7,000 languages spoken in the world today will vanish before the end of this century, taking with them cultural traditions from all over the world, as well as linguistic structures that would have improved our understanding of the universality and variability of human language. This book is an accessible introduction to the topic of language endangerment, answering questions such as: what is it? How and why does it happen? Why should we care? The book outlines the various causes of language endangerment, explaining what makes a language 'safe', and highlighting the danger signs that threaten a minority language. Readers will learn about the consequences of losing a language, both for its former speech community and for our understanding of human language. Illustrated with case studies, it describes the various methods of documenting endangered languages, and shows how they can be revitalised.",['Sarah G.

ETERNITY - sequel to Eon,"This saga of parallel universes from a Hugo and Nebula Award–winning author “may be the best constructed hard SF epic yet” (The Washington Post). One of the world’s preeminent New York Times–bestselling authors of hard science fiction mesmerizes readers with a mind-expanding, three-volume masterwork about the creation of an alternate universe that breaks down all barriers of time and space, and its consequences for future and past generations. Legacy: In the stunning prequel to Eon and Eternity, an agent of the masters of the Way—a man-made tunnel through countless dimensions—follows a renegade fanatic and his four thousand acolytes to a remarkable world of flora/fauna hybrids, where he is plunged into the terrible chaos of a raging civil war. Eon: As nuclear tensions rapidly reach a breaking point in a volatile twenty-first century, a hollowed-out asteroid appears, mysteriously hovering above the Earth’s surface. The asteroid contains the remains of Thistledown, an abandoned city that was once home to survivors of a nuclear holocaust. Scientists must race to unravel its secrets before the human race is annihilated in the impending apocalypse. Eternity: A devastating war has left Earth a nuclear wasteland. Orbiting the planet is an asteroid-starship containing the civilization of Thistledown, humanity’s future descendants. For decades, they have worked to heal their world and its survivors, but their resources are finite. They need to reopen the Way, a gate that would not only benefit Earth but also help the asteroid’s residents return home. Greg Bear’s classic Eon trilogy is an astonishing feat of the imagination that combines humanism, cutting-edge science, and brilliant extrapolation. This masterful science fiction saga has no equal in contemporary speculative fiction.",['Greg Bear'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Cm-9DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Cm-9DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=ETERNITY+-+sequel+to+Eon&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2017-05-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Cm-9DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

The Pittsburgh Steelers,"One of the oldest teams in the NFL, the Pittsburgh Steelers have carved one of the most exciting legacies in professional football. Founded as the Pittsburgh Pirates by Art Rooney in 1933 with winnings from a single day at the racetrack, the Steelers spent the next 40 years as the NFL’s “Lovable Losers.” All that changed in the early ’70s, as savvy draft choices and a smashmouth style of play transformed the Steelers into the most dominant team of the decade.In Tales from the Pittsburgh Steelers Sideline, veteran journalist Dale Grdnic captures the essence of the Steelers teams across the decades. Grdnic highlights many of the squad’s most memorable moments, including Franco Harris’s Immaculate Reception and their eight Super Bowl appearances. He covers the team’s greatest rivalries, including the epic battles with the Oakland Raiders and Dallas Cowboys.

The teachings contained in it were given to him by his Master in preparing him for Initiation, and were written down by him from memory - slowly and laboriously, for his English last year was far less fluent than it is now. The greater part is a reproduction of the Master's own words; that which is not such a verbal reproduction is the Master's thought clothed in His pupil's words. Two omitted sentences were supplied by the Master. In two other cases an omitted word has been added. Beyond this, it is entirely Alcyone's own, his first gift to the world. May it help others as the spoken teachings helped him - such is the hope with which he gives it. But the teaching can only be fruitful if it is lived, as he has lived it, since it fell from the Master's lips.

Voting was not open to students or the public at large. In addition, faculty members voted for educators only at their own college or university. Winners for the 2014-2015 academic year, in all departments and colleges across U.S. institutions of higher education were announced in March 2015 and are permanently archived at FacultyAwards.org, as well as recognized in this 2015 print edition of the Faculty Awards Compendium. For the academic year 2014-2015 votes were cast to nominate and vote for Faculty members, and no self-voting was allowed, to assure the integrity of the whole process. This volume of the Faculty Awards Compendium includes Faculty awardees within Fine Arts, Humanities, Liberal Arts and Social Sciences Disciplines for the 2014-2015 academic year.

In this practical guide, P. Santurette, C.G. Georgiev, and K. Maynard show how to interpret water vapor patterns in terms of dynamical processes in the atmosphere and their relation to diagnostics available from numerical weather prediction models. In particular, they concentrate on the close relationship between satellite imagery and the potential vorticity fields in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. These applications are illustrated with color images based on real meteorological situations over mid-latitudes, subtropical and tropical areas.

"On Feminine Sexuality: The Limits of Love and Knowledge, Encore 1972-1973 (Seminar of Jacques Lacan, Book 20)","Anthology of recent, cutting-edge work in psychoanalysis and philosophy on the concept of inheritance. In contrast to the way inheritance is understood in scientific discourse and culture more broadly, inheritance in psychoanalysis is a paradox. Although it’s impossible, strictly speaking, for the unconscious to be inherited, this volume demonstrates how the concept of inheritance can occasion a rich reassessment and reinvention of psychoanalytic theory and practice. The collection enacts a critical traversal of inheritance for psychoanalysis: from the most basic assumptions of natural or biological inheritance, such as innateness, heredity, evolution, and ontogenesis, to analysis of the ways cultural traditions can be challenged and transformed, and finally to the reinvention of psychoanalytic practice, in which the ethics of inheritance is fully realized as the individual’s responsibility to transform the social bond. Featuring strong interdisciplinary analysis rooted in both psychoanalysis and philosophy, this volume further engages science, politics, and cultural studies, and addresses contemporary political challenges such as autism and transgenderism.","[' Joel Goldbach', 'James A.

Crime Lab Chemistry (Old Edition) (Great Explorations in Math & Science),"With age-appropriate, inquiry-centered curriculum materials and sound teaching practices, middle school science can capture the interest and energy of adolescent students and expand their understanding of the world around them. Resources for Teaching Middle School Science, developed by the National Science Resources Center (NSRC), is a valuable tool for identifying and selecting effective science curriculum materials that will engage students in grades 6 through 8. The volume describes more than 400 curriculum titles that are aligned with the National Science Education Standards. This completely new guide follows on the success of Resources for Teaching Elementary School Science, the first in the NSRC series of annotated guides to hands-on, inquiry-centered curriculum materials and other resources for science teachers. The curriculum materials in the new guide are grouped in five chapters by scientific area-Physical Science, Life Science, Environmental Science, Earth and Space Science, and Multidisciplinary and Applied Science. They are also grouped by type-core materials, supplementary units, and science activity books. Each annotation of curriculum material includes a recommended grade level, a description of the activities involved and of what students can be expected to learn, a list of accompanying materials, a reading level, and ordering information. The curriculum materials included in this book were selected by panels of teachers and scientists using evaluation criteria developed for the guide. The criteria reflect and incorporate goals and principles of the National Science Education Standards. The annotations designate the specific content standards on which these curriculum pieces focus. In addition to the curriculum chapters, the guide contains six chapters of diverse resources that are directly relevant to middle school science. Among these is a chapter on educational software and multimedia programs, chapters on books about science and teaching, directories and guides to science trade books, and periodicals for teachers and students. Another section features institutional resources. One chapter lists about 600 science centers, museums, and zoos where teachers can take middle school students for interactive science experiences. Another chapter describes nearly 140 professional associations and U.S. government agencies that offer resources and assistance. Authoritative, extensive, and thoroughly indexed-and the only guide of its kind-Resources for Teaching Middle School Science will be the most used book on the shelf for science teachers, school administrators, teacher trainers, science curriculum specialists, advocates of hands-on science teaching, and concerned parents.","['Smithsonian Institution', 'National Academy of Engineering', 'National Science Resources Center of the National Academy of Sciences', 'Institute of Medicine']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XgOdAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XgOdAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA48&dq=Crime+Lab+Chemistry+(Old+Edition)+(Great+Explorations+in+Math&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,National Academies Press,1998-04-30,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XgOdAgAAQBAJ&dq=Crime+Lab+Chemistry+(Old+Edition)+(Great+Explorations+in+Math&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Education'],

Vermeer and the Art of Painting,"This book examines the creative process and technical means by which the great Dutch seventeenth-century painter achieved his remarkable pictorial effects. Arthur Wheelock begins by placing Vermeer's art in historical perspective, with emphasis on the artistic environment in his home city of Delft and the importance of history painting in the mid-1600s. He then closely examines seventeen of the thirty-six extant paintings in Vermeer's oeuvre, works that span the range of the artist's career. Using the results of x-rays, pigment analysis, and infrared reflectography, some of the secrets of Vermeer's wonderfully elusive artistry are revealed. For example, Vermeer was able to simulate reality, simplify and highlight meaning, establish a sense of time and permanence, and enhance the mood he wished to create through inventive use of brushwork, color, and compositional refinements. Lavishly illustrated with color reproductions of Vermeer's paintings, the book is certain to appeal to all devotees of Dutch art.",['Arthur K.

The Shadow of Ararat (Oath of Empire),"In what would be A.D. 600 in our history, the Empire still stands, supported by the Legions and Thaumaturges of Rome. Now the Emperor of the West, the Augustus Galen Atreus, will come to the aid of the Emperor of the East, the Augustus Heraclius, to lift the siege of Constantinople and carry a great war to the very doorstep of the Shahanshah of Persia. It is a war that will be fought with armies both conventional and magical, with bright swords and the darkest necromancy. Against this richly detailed canvas of alternate history and military strategy, Thomas Harlan sets the intricate and moving stories of four people. Dwyrin MacDonald is a Hibernian student at a school for sorcerers in Upper Egypt, until he runs afoul of powerful political interests and is sent off half-trained to the Legions. His teacher, Ahmet,undertakes to follow Dwyrin and aid him, but Ahmet is drawn into service with the queen of Palmeyra. Thyatis is a young female warrior, extensively trained by her patron in the arts of covert warfare. And Maxian Atreus is Galens youngest brother, a physician and sorcerer. He has discovered that an enemy of Rome has placed a dreadful curse on the City, which must be broken before Rome can triumph.

"The Tradition of Indian Architecture: Continuity, Change, and the Politics of Style since 1850","Planners tend to promote formal plans as the only game in town while diverse efforts of urban actors shape our cities. Tracking the development of American ""neighborhood unit"" concept in independent India’s planning practice and literature—from the national level policies to on-the-ground applications in the city of Jaipur—Vidyarthi explains how a host of actors including neighborhood residents, squatters, politicians and developers made different kinds of plans that assimilated the design concept in line with their practical concerns and cultural preferences creating unique variants of neighborhood urbanism over time. One Idea, Many Plans counters misguided characterization of these unforeseen efforts as ‘unauthorized’ by state authorities. It shows how the frequently informal and tacit plans were neither arbitrary actions nor aimless subversions but purposeful future-oriented efforts that shaped the envisaged sociality and spatiality of Indian cities in more meaningful ways than the official master plans promoting planned neighborhoods. Carefully illustrating the different kinds of plans local actors use to guide incremental adaptation, improvement and investment, Vidyarthi offers insights about how we might improve formal plan making. Scholars, students and professional practitioners interested in different regions of the global south would find these lessons useful as a new generation of city design ideas like sustainability and new urbanism gain traction in an increasingly globalized World.",['Sanjeev Vidyarthi'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H72gBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H72gBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA143&dq=The+Tradition+of+Indian+Architecture:+Continuity,+Change,+and+the+Politics+of+Style+since+1850&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Routledge,2015-02-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H72gBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],

Tragic Lucidity (Currents in Comparative Romance Languages and Literatures),"Presenting the work of Miguel de Unamuno and Albert Camus as paradigmatic, the present study examines the significance and function of the -tragic- in a modern context, using a historical, socio-political approach. This approach permits the tragic to be seen as a product of specific historical circumstances, rather than as a fundamental, metaphysical aspect of the human condition, first revealed in Greek Tragedy and still evident today. In addition, a connection is made between Unamuno's and Camus's controversial political positions taken at the end of their lives and their insistence upon a tragic human condition.""",['Keith W.

THE VOYAGERS.,"Many ex-coalminers will find in this novel a powerful reminder of their own life ‘down the pit’ as it skilfully recreates a typical day in the life of Luke, a British coalface worker in the 1970’s. Although the main action takes place over a single day and just one shift, the author delves back into Luke’s trainee days in the 1950’s. But it’s not just old miners who will benefit from this story as the author carefully explains the various operations involved in bringing coal out from deep in the ground up to the surface and all the various specialists forming this tremendous team effort, from the shotfirers and rippers to the deputies, belt-end attendants and lamp-room men, electricians and mechanics, the tackle runners and the haulage men, the grease monkeys and the workers at the coal face itself, struggling to maintain productivity in the face of never-ending management demands.",['Michael Walsh'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HSpMCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=HSpMCAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=THE+VOYAGERS.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Lulu Press, Inc",2014-06-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HSpMCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

The aim is to provide graduate students with a toolkit for understanding astronomical phenomena that involve velocities close to that of light or intense gravitational fields.

Examples of relativistic gravitation in action are drawn from the astrophysical domain. The book can be read on two levels: first as an introductory fast-track course, and then as a detailed course reinforced by problems which illuminate technical examples.

He dug into old records, recalled old times, and talked with old-timers. He illuminated the transition of a town, from Estherville’s pioneer settlement to the busy, active town it is today. The excitement and fun begin with a story of bootleggers, Chautauqua meetings, and an accomplished arsonist—who achieves in less than two months the impressive score of burning seven barns and one feed store, with an unsuccessful attempt on the Methodist church. Scandinavians move in, build crude shelters for the first winter, and add their special characteristics to the town. The Irish arrive and stamp their mark on the whole territory. The circus comes to town and entrances everyone with its ancient pageantry. The railroads come through and add a rowdy element to the population. The Depression begins and farms see 11-cent corn, 108-degree heat, and a twister. All these events, plus adventures with a massive meteorite and haunting river tragedies, create the drama and flow of small-town life, story by story, in a fascinating revelation of Americana.",['Deemer Lee'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ObtcE5irdpgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ObtcE5irdpgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Esther%27s+town&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Iowa Press,2013-03-15,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ObtcE5irdpgC&dq=Esther%27s+town&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0

John Lennon: The New York Years,"Published to coincide with the 35th anniversary of John Lennon's death and the 75th anniversary of his birth, this is an intimate album of photographs, most never published before, of Lennon in his last decade. A musical genius, an innovator, a peace activist--John Lennon was all these and more, and he continues to be revered years after his shocking murder in New York elevated him to mythic stature. Bob Gruen first photographed Lennon in 1971 and became his personal photographer and close friend shortly thereafter. Over the course of the next nine years, Gruen would photograph him extensively. This book assembles the most revealing of those images, taken during Lennon's treasured years in New York, together with Gruen's reflections on the circumstances surrounding the photos, including John's relationship with Yoko, how he dealt with fame, and his experiences with fatherhood. The result is a remarkable behind-the-scenes look at John Lennon as a performer, a legend, and a person.",['Bob Gruen'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vJlhrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vJlhrgEACAAJ&dq=John+Lennon:+The+New+York+Years&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harry N.

Grown-Up Fast,"The first edition of Growing Up Fast attempted to counter the stereotype of poor, minority adolescent mothers and describe the diversity of their educational, work, parenting, and relationship experiences. The volume followed a strengths-based approach to understanding why some mothers appeared resilient to the stresses of early parenting, compared to their peers, and what obstacles undermine resiliency for some of these young women. We hear their stories in their own words. We also see how many disadvantaged mothers go on to succeed in school, work, and parenting while avoiding many of the risk associated with teen parenting . The research is based on a six-year study of 120 young disadvantaged mothers and their children from New York City. It uniquely combines the analysis of longitudinal questionnaire data with qualitative analysis of extensive interviews conducted with these women focusing on the first six years after their child was born. A past winner of the Society for Research on Adolescence best book award, Growing Up Fast is a fascinating study of human resilience that will continue to be recognized for its contribution to individuals involved in program development and policymaking with teenage parenting. A new introductory chapter to the book suggests that we can look at the previous findings through a new lens that emphasizes not only the diversity of outcomes for young mothers and the sources of their strengths, but also asks what we can learn from these women about supporting their educational and work goals, as they transition to adulthood. New attention to emerging adulthood shows that this is a critical stage of life when the foundations for health and healthy life styles are laid down. Developmental tasks of this phase include building the capacity for financial and residential independence through post-secondary education and job training, and establishing stable sources of support from parents, romantic partners, and peers for all youth. Leadbeater addresses the societal changes that make these tasks particularly salient for young women and focuses attention on how we can support youth who make this transition with children.",['Bonnie J.

Botany and bugs, geology and geese, and creeks and crows; living in a major city doesn't have to separate us from the natural world.

Williams addresses questions that an observant person asks in an urban environment. What did Seattle look like before Europeans got here? How does the area's geologic past affect us? Why have some animals thrived and other languished? How are we affected by the species with whom we share the urban environment and how do we affect them?

Al Partir (Spanish Edition),"BESTSELLER #1 DEL NEW YORK TIMES Mark R. Levin, autor seis veces bestseller #1 del New York Times, estrella de Fox News y presentador de radio, regresa para explicar cómo aquellos peligros sobre los que nos advirtió hace una década finalmente han ocurrido…y lo que se debe hacer ahora para hacerlos retroceder. Mark R. Levin movilizó a los conservadores en 2009 con Libertad y tiranía, el cual brindó un marco filosófico, histórico y práctico para detener el ataque liberal contra los valores basados en la Constitución, que hizo su aparición durante los años de Obama. Ese libro hablaba de que estábamos parados frente al precipicio del ataque del progresismo a nuestras libertades, desde la economía hasta la atención médica, y desde el calentamiento global hasta la inmigración. Ahora, más de una década después, hemos ido más allá de ese precipicio…y estamos pagando el precio. En Marxismo norteamericano, Levin explica cómo hoy en día los elementos centrales de la ideología marxista se han generalizado en la sociedad y la cultura estadounidenses—desde nuestras instituciones educativas, la prensa y las corporaciones hasta Hollywood, el partido Demócrata y la presidencia de Biden—y cómo a menudo se la disfraza con rótulos engañosos como “progresismo,” “socialismo democrático,” “activismo social,” y “activismo comunitario”. Con su característico análisis incisivo, Levin se sumerge en la psicología y las tácticas de estos movimientos de masas, el extendido lavado de cerebro de estudiantes, los propósitos antiestadounidenses de la Teoría Crítica de la Raza y del Green New Deal y la escalada de represión y censura para silenciar a voces opositoras e imponer la conformidad. Levin expone a un gran número de instituciones, intelectuales, académicos y activistas que lideran esta revolución, y nos brinda algunas respuestas e ideas sobre cómo confrontarlos. Como escribe Levin: “La contrarrevolución a la Revolución norteamericana está en pleno vigor. Y ya no puede ser desestimada ni ignorada, porque está devorando a nuestra sociedad y a nuestra cultura, rondando en nuestras vidas cotidianas y omnipresente en nuestra política, en nuestras escuelas, en los medios y en la industria del entretenimiento”. Y, tal como hizo antes, Levin busca unir al pueblo estadounidense para que defienda su libertad.",['Mark R.

Xenocide (Ender Wiggins Saga (Paperback)),"The war for survival of the planet Lusitania will be fought in the heart of a child named Gloriously Bright. On Lusitania, Ender found a world where humans and pequininos and the Hive Queen could all live together; where three very different intelligent species could find common ground at last. Or so he thought. Lusitania also harbors the descolada, a virus that kills all humans it infects, but which the pequininos require in order to become adults.

Supremely Abominable Crimes,"Suddenly, at dawn on Friday 13 October 1307, King Philip IV of France's officials arrested the Knights Templar throughout his kingdom. It took seven years to interrogate them and sift the evidence, after which the greatest of the crusading orders was abolished, its enormous wealth sequestered, and its Grand Master burned at the stake. Who were the Knights Templar? How was it that these powerful and wealthy warriors found themselves vilified and accused of the most depraved crimes? To answer these questions and to unravel the mystery that has shrouded the Order ever since, Edward Burman, through contemporary sources, including transcripts made by Papal notaries, provide a detailed account of the sensational three-month trial in Paris in 1310, and reflects on the background to the myths surrounding the Order which led to their arrest.",['Edward Burman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4M1INwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4M1INwAACAAJ&dq=Supremely+Abominable+Crimes&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1994,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4M1INwAACAAJ&dq=Supremely+Abominable+Crimes&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

"The Autism Sourcebook: Everything You Need to Know About Diagnosis, Treatment, Coping, and Healing--from a Mother Whose Child Recovered","Practical advice and information from the world's foremost experts on autism -- and a mother's own hard-won lessons from helping her son recover from the disorder When Karen Siff Exkorn's son, Jake, was diagnosed with autism, she struggled to pull together comprehensive information about the disorder. Fortunately, she was able to educate herself quickly, and her extensive at-home treatment of her son led to his amazing full recovery. But the journey wasn't easy, and now, in The Autism Sourcebook, Siff Exkorn offers parents the wisdom she wishes she'd had at the beginning. Recent studies show that there is a worldwide epidemic of autism. More than 1.5 million people are affected in the United States alone, with one in every 166 children diagnosed. Early detection and early intervention are two of the key factors in improving prognosis -- but too often, writes Siff Exkorn, parents get bogged down in denial or confusion about the still mysterious disorder, and are unable to take the necessary steps. Providing accessible medical information gleaned from the world's foremost experts, Siff Exkorn offers an inside look at families with children who have autism, and ties in her own firsthand experience as a parent. The author shares valuable knowledge about the following: What the diagnosis really means Understanding and accessing treatment options Knowing your child's rights in the school system Coping with common marital and familial stress Making the stigma of autism a thing of the past With extensive appendices, including the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Diagnostic Criteria for the Five Pervasive Developmental Disorders, and carefully selected lists of Internet resources, recommended readings, and top autism organizations worldwide, The Autism Sourcebook is the single most comprehensive, practical resource available to parents and loved ones of children with autism.",['Karen Siff Exkorn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aUcZHzvUqwYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aUcZHzvUqwYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Autism+Sourcebook:+Everything+You+Need+to+Know+About+Diagnosis,+Treatment,+Coping,+and+Healing--from+a+Mother+Whose+Child+Recovered&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Harper Collins,2009-03-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aUcZHzvUqwYC&source=gbs_api,['Health & Fitness'],1.0

A Passage To India (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition),"Bijna zes jaar na het overweldigende succes van Een weeffout in onze sterren schrijft John Green met Schildpadden tot in het oneindige opnieuw een briljante en onvergetelijke roman. Het begint allemaal met een nieuwsbericht over een voortvluchtige miljardair en het vooruitzicht van een grote beloning voor de gouden tip over zijn verblijfplaats. Schildpadden tot in het oneindige gaat over vriendschap voor het leven, onverwachte ontmoetingen, Star Wars-fanfictie en een tuatara die op het punt staat een fortuin te erven. Maar bovenal gaat het over Aza Holmes, een meisje dat worstelt met een dwangstoornis en klem komt te zitten in de verstikkende spiraal van haar gedachten. In dit langverwachte nieuwe boek deelt John Green het verhaal van Aza met verpletterende directheid: 'Dit is mijn eerste poging om openlijk te schrijven over de stoornis waar ikzelf sinds mijn vroegste jeugd mee worstel. Het verhaal is verzonnen, maar gaat wel degelijk ook over mij persoonlijk.'",['John Green'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4_c4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4_c4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=A+Passage+To+India+(Turtleback+School&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Gottmer,2017-10-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4_c4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Juvenile Fiction'],1.0

In today?s competitive, fast-paced world of manufacturing, every aspect of a company?s operation must be highly responsive to a customer?s needs.

Anyone involved in designing and maintaining a company?s master schedule will find a wealth of practical, proven advice in Master Scheduling. From sales and marketing to manufacturing, materials management, and engineering, Proud includes important advice for integrating all areas of a company within the framework of an effective master schedule. In every chapter of this edition, Proud introduces important new material to ensure complete and up-to-date coverage of this constantly evolving field. Two entirely new chapters covering the process industry and manufacturing at multiple sites?domestically and internationally?have been added. The new chapter covering the process industry identifies where the master scheduling mechanics and management issues are similar to intermittent manufacturing, as well as different.

Alexandria,"Hypatia—brilliant mathematician, eloquent Neoplatonist, and a woman renowned for her beauty—was brutally murdered by a mob of Christians in Alexandria in 415. She has been a legend ever since. In this engrossing book, Maria Dzielska searches behind the legend to bring us the real story of Hypatia's life and death, and new insight into her colorful world. Historians and poets, Victorian novelists and contemporary feminists have seen Hypatia as a symbol—of the waning of classical culture and freedom of inquiry, of the rise of fanatical Christianity, or of sexual freedom. Dzielska shows us why versions of Hypatia's legend have served her champions' purposes, and how they have distorted the true story. She takes us back to the Alexandria of Hypatia's day, with its Library and Museion, pagan cults and the pontificate of Saint Cyril, thriving Jewish community and vibrant Greek culture, and circles of philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers, and militant Christians. Drawing on the letters of Hypatia's most prominent pupil, Synesius of Cyrene, Dzielska constructs a compelling picture of the young philosopher's disciples and her teaching. Finally she plumbs her sources for the facts surrounding Hypatia's cruel death, clarifying what the murder tells us about the tensions of this tumultuous era.",['Maria Dzielska'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UCkgLBCh2m0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UCkgLBCh2m0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Alexandria&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harvard University Press,1996-10,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UCkgLBCh2m0C&dq=Alexandria&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Perdurabo (the magical name Crowley chose when inducted into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn) traces Crowley’s remarkable journey from his birth as the only son of a wealthy lay preacher to his death in a boarding house as the world’s foremost authority on magick. Along the way, he rebels against his conservative religious upbringing; befriends famous artists, writers, and philosophers (and becomes a poet himself ); is attacked for his practice of “the black arts”; and teaches that science and magick can work together. While seeking to spread his infamous philosophy of “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,” Crowley becomes one of the most notorious figures of his day. Based on Richard Kaczynski’s twenty years of research, and including previously unpublished biographical details, Perdurabo paints a memorable portrait of the man who inspired the counterculture and influenced generations of artists, punks, wiccans, and other denizens of the demimonde.",['Richard Kaczynski'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_A23t1hGFwUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_A23t1hGFwUC&pg=PA660&dq=Freedom+is+a+Two-Edged+Sword+and+Other+Essays+Oriflamme+1&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,North Atlantic Books,2012-04-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_A23t1hGFwUC&source=gbs_api,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",5.0

The Robot Who Looks Like Me,"“If the Marx Brothers had been literary fantasists, they would have been Robert Sheckley.” —Harlan Ellison In “The Robot Who Looked Like Me,” a busy man and a busy woman find a way to carve out time to romance each other—by having look-alike robots made to do the job—who then run away together.

Open Road is proud to republish his acclaimed body of work, with nearly thirty volumes of full-length fiction and short story collections.

The Battle of the Bulge: Hitler's Final Gamble,"By late 1944 the Allies were poised to smash the Siegfried Line and break into Germany. Supply lines were shorter thanks to the port of Antwerp.

Fog and low cloud negated the Allies' air supremacy, English-speaking German commandos in captured jeeps created panic and withdrawal of US forces became a near rout with morale all but broken.For ten days the situation worsened and Antwerp was seriously threatened and 21st Army Group in danger of being cut off.Clear skies for the Thunderbolts and coherent counter-attacks by rapidly deployed reinforcements turned the tide in the nick of time, so preventing a catastrophic defeat for the Allies.All this and more is graphically narrated in this fine study of a pivotal battle, that so nearly changed the course of war.",['Patrick Delaforce'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TEQRBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=TEQRBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Battle+of+the+Bulge:+Hitler%27s+Final+Gamble&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Pen and Sword,2014-04-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TEQRBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],

They find that the Catholic schools do have an independent effect on achievement, especially in reducing disparities between disadvantaged and privileged students. The Catholic school of today, they show, is informed by a vision, similar to that of John Dewey, of the school as a community committed to democratic education and the common good of all students.","['Anthony S.

Claude Bernard's experiments on animals, in his studies of the nervous system, caused outrage among antivivisectionists and led to his being disowned by his family.

Jimmy Stewart: A Wonderful Life,"Over a career that spanned forty-three years and seventy-seven films, Jimmy Stewart went from leading man to national idol. Classics such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, The Philadelphia Story, Harvey, and, of course, It’s A Wonderful Life are far more than mere movies; they are visions of America as it wanted to be seen. With his inimitable (though widely mimicked) down-home drawl, Jimmy Stewart came to embody the ideal American male, lean, affably sarcastic, honorable, endearingly awkward. His double takes were memorable; his way of muttering his asides charmed audiences. Most of all, he was the man whose heart was always in the right place, and who would see always see his way clear to doing the right thing. “If Bess and I had a son,” Harry Truman once said, “we’d want him to be just like Jimmy Stewart.” Jonathon Coe traces Stewart’s beginnings in a small town in Pennsylvania, his amateur dramatics and college years at Princeton, and the early films and stardom through to his heroics as an air force pilot during World War II and his triumphant return to Hollywood. Though he was adored in black and white, Stewart’s mature work shows his range as an actor, his ability to play far more than just the good-natured leading man. By the time he retired from acting, Stewart had films credits that were unparalleled—and a place in the American heart that was unrivaled. Illustrated with 150 photographs, taken on and off the set, this handsome tribute gives us the private man as well as the screen legend and guides us through the whole wonderful life of Jimmy Stewart.",['Jonathan Coe'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2TyCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=2TyCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jimmy+Stewart:+A+Wonderful+Life&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2017-01-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2TyCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Performing Arts'],

Jung and the Lost Gospels: Insights Into the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi Library,"The Lost Gospels refer to the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi Library, both discovered in the 1940s. The Nag Hammadi Library consists of writings found by two peasants who unearthed clay jars in 1945 in upper Egypt. These did not appear in English for 32 years, because the right to publish was contended by scholars, politicians, and antique dealers. The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in clay jars in Palestine by a goat herder in 1947, weathered similar storms. The first team of analysts were mostly Christian clergy, who weren't anxious to share material that frightened church leaders. As Dr. Hoeller shows, they rightly feared the documents would reveal information that might detract from unique claims of Christianity. Indeed, the Dead Sea Scrolls and Nag Hammadi Library both contradict and complement accepted tenets of the Old and New Testaments. As to the connection with Jung, Dr. Hoeller states, Jung knew that the one and only tradition associated with Christianity that regarded the human psyche as the container of the divine-human encounter was that of the Gnostics of the the first three centuries of our era. For this reason he called for a renewed appreciation of this ancient tradition, and particularly for a return to the Gnostic sense of God as an inner directing and transforming presence. Dr. Hoeller goes on in his preface, His sympathetic insight into the myths, symbols, and metaphors of the Gnostics, whom by his own admission he regarded as long-lost friends, continues as the brightest beacon of our day... Chapters include such topics as Saintly Rebels: The People of the Scrolls, The Dancing Savior: The Myth of the Gnostic Christ and The Secret Sayings of Jesus: The Gospel of Thomas. The book also includes a thorough notes section as well as an index.",['Stephan A.

It Can Break Your Heart,"100 of the most moving and inspiring poems of the last 200 years from around the world, a collection that will comfort and enthrall anyone trapped by grief or loneliness, selected by the award-winning, best-selling, and beloved author of How to Read a Poem Implicit in poetry is the idea that we are enriched by heartbreaks, by the recognition and understanding of suffering--not just our own suffering but also the pain of others. We are not so much diminished as enlarged by grief, by our refusal to vanish, or to let others vanish, without leaving a record. And poets are people who are determined to leave a trace in words, to transform oceanic depths of feeling into art that speaks to others. In 100 Poems to Break Your Heart, poet and advocate Edward Hirsch selects 100 poems, from the nineteenth century to the present, and illuminates them, unpacking context and references to help the reader fully experience the range of emotion and wisdom within these poems.

Its most prominent feature is inevitably a Dictionary of the Chinese Characters used in writing Proper Names, accompanied bv their various Readings and a sufficiency of actual Examples to illustrate their use in this connection, singly or in combination.

Those who are inclined to fight shy of dictionaries may be reminded that the only conceivable alternative, to keep pace with even the collector's more limited requirements, lies in a well-nigh illimitable series of facsimiles or transcripts of actual signatures, etc., a series which, apart from its unwieldy bulk and prohibitive cost, would be.

We Keep A Light,"In this classic memoir of life in rural Nova Scotia, a woman recounts her family’s experiences running a lighthouse station on their own island. In We Keep A Light, Evelyn M. Richardson describes how she and her husband bought tiny Bon Portage Island and built a happy life there for themselves and their three children. On an isolated lighthouse station off the southern tip of Nova Scotia, the Richardsons shared the responsibilities and pleasures of island living, from carrying water and collecting firewood to making preserves and studying at home. The close-knit family didn’t mind their isolation. Instead, they found delight in the variety and beauty of island life. We Keep A Light is much more than a memoir. It is an exquisitely written, engrossing record of family life set against a glowing lighthouse, the enduring shores of Nova Scotia, and the ever-changing sea.",['Evelyn Richardson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nXEnEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nXEnEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT33&dq=We+Keep+A+Light&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Nimbus+ORM,2005-05-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nXEnEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Solder Joint Reliability: Theory and applications,"Solders have given the designer of modern consumer, commercial, and military electronic systems a remarkable flexibility to interconnect electronic components. The properties of solder have facilitated broad assembly choices that have fueled creative applications to advance technology. Solder is the electrical and me chanical ""glue"" of electronic assemblies. This pervasive dependency on solder has stimulated new interest in applica tions as well as a more concerted effort to better understand materials properties. We need not look far to see solder being used to interconnect ever finer geo metries. Assembly of micropassive discrete devices that are hardly visible to the unaided eye, of silicon chips directly to ceramic and plastic substrates, and of very fine peripheral leaded packages constitute a few of solder's uses. There has been a marked increase in university research related to solder. New electronic packaging centers stimulate applications, and materials engineering and science departments have demonstrated a new vigor to improve both the materials and our understanding of them. Industrial research and development continues to stimulate new application, and refreshing new packaging ideas are emerging. New handbooks have been published to help both the neophyte and seasoned packaging engineer.",['John H.

Thus, films about a nation’s wars are never “only a movie” but rather should be considered a cultural battleground themselves on which a war of representation is waged.",['Terence McSweeney'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_G9vEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_G9vEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA103&dq=The+Hurt&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Liverpool University Press,2019-07-02,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_G9vEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Hurt&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

"Dear Bill, Remember Me","Eight extraordinary stories of heartbreak, growing up, and the importance of finding your voice Everything changes eventually. Jessie Granatstein doesn’t think she’ll have anything to say in the journal her teacher asks her to write—until suddenly, the words come tumbling out. Zoe Eberhardt has been raised and cherished by the strong, powerful women in her family, but when she turns fourteen, she starts to see that she’ll soon have to establish an identity of her own. Marylee is quiet and thoughtful—unlike her confident, sparkling mother. But when she sees something she’s not supposed to, she realizes it might be time to start speaking out. For the young women in these stories, growing up may be complicated, but it always leads in surprising new directions.",['Norma Fox Mazer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IIG8BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IIG8BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dear+Bill,+Remember+Me&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Open Road Media,2015-05-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IIG8BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Young Adult Fiction'],

The Hostile Sky: A Hellcat Flyer in World War II,"In the summer of 1942 Jim Vernon, a nineteen-year-old college student in Butte, Montana, joined the U.S. Navy's aviation cadet training program and by the spring of 1945 was flying F6F Hellcats from the USS Ticonderoga off of the coast of Japan. This memoir of his years at war provides a carrier pilot's view of the conflict in the Pacific during the final months of the war when the atomic bombs were dropped and Japan capitulated. He gives an up-close-and-personal account of life in a bomber-fighter squadron and the roller-coaster emotions involved in combat sorties over the hostile sea and land. As a member of VBF-87, Vernon offers a unique glimpse into the past at a time when teenagers matured rapidly as they faced the realities of war. He has recorded his own feelings about meeting the challenges of war, his love of flying, and the camaraderie of his flying mates--both in the air and on liberty--along with the factual details of battle that contribute important dimensions to the overall story of the air war. Added to these stirring memories are his entertaining descriptions of the mobilization and training of carrier pilots and his recounting of the high incidence of non-combat fatalities and the change in the composition of the air group in response to the Kamikaze threat. Such a book not only will appeal to aviators everywhere but also will prove to be a thrilling read for those interested in World War II and air combat.",['James Vernon'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bZvzAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=bZvzAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Hostile+Sky:+A+Hellcat+Flyer+in+World+War+II&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Naval Institute Press,2014-03-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bZvzAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],

What Jesus Said About it,"What Jesus said . . . “Follow me and go on a mission.” And didn’t say . . . “Follow me and go to heaven.” The main thesis of the book is derived from Matthew, Mark, and Luke. In these Synoptic Gospels, Jesus never mentions heaven, except when speaking of God the Father. Being a this-world incarnation of God, he emphasizes life on earth and not the new environment after death. Our Lord explains that the mission will always involve both words and actions. The words should make two things clear: (1) the one who calls is the man Jesus who is the true revelation of God and (2) one’s relationship with God is a reflection of Jesus’s perfect relationship with the Father. The actions should be in the selfless lifestyle of Jesus himself.",['Glenn C.

Essays of a Catholic,"AN EYE-OPENING BOOK FROM A BRILLIANT, BELOVED CATHOLIC WRITER! Essays of a Catholic is a book as provocative now as it was when it first appeared in 1931. Hilaire Belloc’s observations about our civilization’s demise are all the more urgent today, because they are proving to be prophetic. We are troubled witnesses to many of the evils he predicted as we watch the working out of the destructive trends and forces that he warned would lead to disaster. What key insight led to Belloc’s keen discernment of the times? He recognized that the Catholic Church has inspired and formed our great Western civilization. As the influence of that mighty institution wanes, then—as society slowly abandons what it has learned from her—the night¬ descends on our way of life as we have known it. In its stead emerges a new paganism, and with it, a new barbarism. In these essays, Belloc sharpens our awareness of the calamitous effects of this waning influence of the Catholic Church in society. There is hope for the future of our civilization—but only if we as a people embrace once more the liberating truth of the Catholic faith. The great Hilaire Belloc was one of the foremost Catholic historians of the past two centuries. His astute analysis of our cultural and social ills culminates in an urgent prophetic call for Western civilization to return to its Catholic roots.",['Hilaire Belloc'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=00YhCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=00YhCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Essays+of+a+Catholic&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,TAN Books,2009-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=00YhCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],
"Caesar and Cleopatra,","Exclusive to Penguin Classics: the definitive text of one of Shakespeare’s most affecting plays—part of the official Bernard Shaw Library A Penguin Classic In a cheeky nod to Shakespeare’s towering reputation, Shaw reinvents two of his historical characters but sets his own play in a period predating both Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra. Shaw’s Cleopatra is a kittenish girl with a streak of cruelty, while his Caesar is a world-weary philosopher-soldier who is as much a stranger in Rome as in the barbaric court of Egypt. With wit, irony, and an undertone of melancholy, Caesar and Cleopatra satirizes Shakespeare’s use of history and comments wryly on the politics of Shaw’s own time. This is the definitive text prepared under the editorial supervision of Dan H. Laurence. The volume includes Shaw’s preface of 1900.","['George Bernard Shaw', 'Dan H.

Who Dies,"Bioethics asks fundamental questions. ""Who lives? Who dies? Who decides?"" These questions are relevant to us all. Too often, the general public's sole encounter with these weighty questions is through sound bites fed to us by the media-where complex, difficult matters are typically presented in superficial and inaccurate terms. Here, renowned bioethicist Albert R. Jonsen equips readers with the tools and background to navigate the fascinating and complex landscape of bioethics. Bioethics Beyond the Headlines is a primer. You will not find convoluted philosophical arguments in this volume. Rather, you will find an engaging sampling of the key questions in bioethics, including euthanasia, assisted reproduction, cloning and stem cells, neuroscience, access to healthcare, and even research on animals and questions of environmental ethics-areas typically overlooked in general introductions to bioethics. But a ""primer"" is not merely a first book-it should also ""prime"" the interest of the reader, to prepare the mind for a more expansive venture into these issues. Bioethics Beyond the Headlines intends to do just that.",['Albert R.

THE HILL OF DEVI.,"An essential companion to A Passage to India, a collection of the author’s own letters that read like “a close personal friend has shared his impressions” (Kirkus Reviews). In 1912, a young E. M. Forster traveled to India to serve as a secretary to the Maharajah of Dewas, a small Indian state. He was elevated to the rank of a minor noble, and eventually given the state’s highest honor, the Tukoji Rao III gold medal. This brief episode in Forster’s life became the basis for his masterwork, A Passage to India. In the letters included in The Hill of Devi, he shares his personal journey of discovering his beloved India for the first time. Forster paints a vivid, intimate picture of Dewas State—a strange, bewildering, and enchanting slice of pre-independence India. In this collection, Forster shares insight into the lives of Indian royalty and accounts of the stark contrast between their excesses and the poverty he encounters. From letters that set the scene for Forster’s lifelong friendship with the Maharaja, to an essay on the Maharaja himself and Forster’s experiences as the Maharaja’s personal secretary, The Hill of Devi is a fascinating chronicle of the author’s experience in the land he called “the oddest corner of the world outside Alice in Wonderland.”",['E.

Intelligence and Instincts: Understanding Yourself and Others (Spanish Edition),"Who's really in charge? Your intellect or your survival instinct? Are you smart, sophisticated and evolved, or are you an insecure, emotional group-thinker like the rest of us? Evolutionology represents a new approach to understanding the evolution of the human mind and our psychology. It describes how our survival instinct actually works, how it makes us think and behave, as well as how to regain control and heighten our emotional intelligence. We humans like to believe that we are already evolved, civilized creatures because we are intelligent, but we are clearly not living intelligently. Our lives and world are filled with stress, anxiety and dysfunction. The reason is that our choices are not made by our intelligence, but rather by our survival instinct. Our fears and emotions are behind our decisions, and every action we take is designed to make us feel safer. We do what is comforting, not what is right. We seek corroboration, not truth. We react instead of choosing, thinking emotionally and declaring it intelligent. Seeing this is a necessary first step in order to evolve consciously. Until we do, our inner animal will continue holding the reins and controlling our thoughts and actions, while we will congratulate ourselves on our superiority, correctness, and wisdom. Evolutionology describes self-evident truths that can empower us to better understand people. When we understand how the mind works, we gain deeper insight into the human condition, and with it, the power to effectively and consciously change our lives. FEATURING: The Evolutionology Quiz. In order to bring this to a very practical level, this book features a simple, online multiple choice quiz that will allow you to measure your degree of evolution. But, beware.

The Five Fingered Family,"Now a PBS documentary, this astonishing memoir of growing up in rough-and-tumble Jersey City “will steal your heart” (People) With deadpan humor and obvious affection, Five-Finger Discount recounts the story of an unforgettable New Jersey family of swindlers, bookies, embezzlers, and mobster-wannabes. In the memoir Mary Karr calls “a page-turner,” Helene Stapinski ingeniously weaves the checkered history of her hometown of Jersey City—a place known for its political corruption and industrial blight—with the tales that have swirled around her relatives for decades. Navigating a childhood of toxic waste and tough love, Stapinski tells an extraordinary tale at once heartbreaking and hysterically funny. Praise for Five-Finger Discount “By turns hilarious and alarming, [Helene Stapinski’s] book reads on the surface like something by Damon Runyon and Elmore Leonard, with a dark undertow of real-life pain and disillusion.”—Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times “It’s a brilliant book, a darling book. It is the blessedly modest chronicle of a magical consciousness that seems to have been born pulling diamonds out of the muck, hearing angels’ voices in the fiercest thunder. . . . I adored every word of this wondrous book. Get it. Read it.”—Michael Pakenham, The Baltimore Sun “In the tradition of . . . Rita Mae Brown and Amy Tan, Ms. Stapinski is an exciting writer, unabashedly candid, and at the same time unashamedly self-contained. Five-Finger Discount is a must-read.”—Victoria Gotti, The New York Observer “What [Frank] McCourt did for Limerick, Ireland, Helene Stapinski does for Jersey City.”—The Star-Ledger “Hugely entertaining.”—The Sunday Times (London)",['Helene Stapinski'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UuQ44Avk74IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UuQ44Avk74IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Five+Fingered+Family&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House Trade Paperbacks,2002-03-12,http://books.google.com/books?id=UuQ44Avk74IC&dq=The+Five+Fingered+Family&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],7.0
The World of Tiers Volume One (The World of Tiers),"The first three adventures set in the amazing realm created by the Hugo Award–winning author of Riverworld and “an excellent science fiction writer” (Isaac Asimov). His past a mystery and his present unbearably mundane, Robert Wolff is simply trying to buy a new house in Arizona when he stumbles upon a secret doorway through space and time and enters the World of Tiers. Made up of ascending levels of jungles, plains, medieval cities, and, at the top, a Garden of Eden, and populated by fantastical creatures, from nymphs and centaurs to merpeople and strange amalgams nonexistent on Earth, it’s beyond anything Wolff could have imagined in his previous humdrum existence. And when his youth is restored in the bargain, it seems he’s truly found paradise. But there are dark forces in this new world, and Wolff is plunged into an epic quest up through the tiers, accompanied by Paul Janus Finnegan, another earthling, now known as Kickaha. Wolff’s journey to find Jadawin, the Lord of this world, will lead to answers about his own identity—and determine his fate. Wolff and Kickaha will face off against feuding Lords—who hold the power to control private worlds of their own design—and the depraved Bellers. Devices originally created in the biolabs of the Lords, the Bellers are now conscious entities waging war on the Lords and their “pocket universes.” As they infiltrate the bodies of creatures throughout the World of Tiers and hunt down the Earth-born, the survival of all the worlds hinges upon the battle between the strangers from Earth and enemies disguised as their allies.

Swords and Deviltry : Book 1 of the Adventures of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser,"The Hugo and Nebula Award–winning series of swords and sorcery, featuring two unorthodox heroes, from a Grand Master of Science Fiction and Fantasy. Many decades before George R. R. Martin’s Game of Thrones, Grand Master Fritz Leiber ruled the sword-and-sorcery universe. These three short story collections chronicle the unconventional adventures of Leiber’s endearing antiheroes: barbarian Fafhrd and former wizard’s apprentice, the Gray Mouser. Swords and Deviltry: Fafhrd, a handsome barbarian of the Steppes, is seduced by a beautiful prostitute and her equally intoxicating city, while the Gray Mouser, a slum rat wizard-in-training, is tempted by the dark arts. The two men meet on a night of multiple thieveries and an enduring partnership is born. Swords Against Death: Rogue swordsmen and devoted companions Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser pursue ill-gotten fortunes within the confines of Lankhmar. They cross paths with two wizards, Sheelba of the Eyeless Face and Ningauble of the Seven Eyes, and a most violent clash ensues. Eventually, following further adventures, the two antiheroes end up as indentured swordsman servants to their former foes. Swords in the Mist: A cloud of concentrated hatred and lean times in Lankhmar compels Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser to temporarily depart the most corrupt metropolis in all of Nehwon as they seek adventure in the realm of the Sea-King—and on a different world entirely. This must-read collection of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser short stories features multiple Hugo and Nebula Award–nominated tales, and includes the acclaimed novella Ill Met in Lankhmar.",['Fritz Leiber'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rzotDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=rzotDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Swords+and+Deviltry+:+Book+1+of+the+Adventures+of+Fafhrd+and+the+Gray+Mouser&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2017-08-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rzotDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

"Advances in Chemical Physics, Volume 119: Modern Nonlinear Optics, Parts 1-3, 2nd Edition","A comprehensive and up-to-date resource for the study of nonlinear optics Modern Nonlinear Optics serves as an updated, second edition of volume 85 of the series Advances in Chemical Physics. Utilizing the research of world-renowned experts, Modern Nonlinear Optics presents a dialogue between two prevailing schools of thought: one concerned with quantum optics and Abelian electrodynamics, the other with the emerging subject of non-Abelian electrodynamics and unified field theory. The prevailing paradigm–the Maxwell Heaviside theory–is developed in fields such as quantum optics, antenna theory, and holography, but it is also challenged using general relativity, O(3) electrodynamics, superluminal effects, and several other theories. This wide spectrum of opinion is presented so that a consensus can emerge. In addition, Modern Nonlinear Optics surveys developments over the last ten years, including advances in light squeezing, single photon optics, phase conjunction optics, and laser technology. It reviews thousands of papers emerging from both schools of thought and provides the most up-to-date and complete coverage available.","['Myron Wyn Evans', 'Ilya Prigogine', 'Stuart A.

It is the story of how, in Vietnam, an elite group of Air Force pilots fought a secret air war in Cessna 0-2 and OV-10 Bronco prop planes—flying as low as they could get. The eyes and ears of the fast-moving jets who rained death and destruction down on enemy positions, the forward air controller made an art form out of an air strike—knowing the targets, knowing where friendly troops were, and reacting with split-second, life-and-death decisions as a battle unfolded. The expertise of the low, slow FACs, as well as the hazard attendant to their role, made for a unique bird’s-eye perspective on how the entire war in Vietnam unfolded. For Tom Yarborough, who logged 1,500 hours of combat flying time, the risk was constant, intense, and electrifying. A member of the super-secret “Prairie Fire” unit, Yarborough became one of the most frequently shot-up pilots flying out of Da Nang—engaging in a series of dangerous secret missions in Laos. In this work, the reader flies in the cockpit alongside Yarborough in his adrenaline-pumping chronicle of heroism, danger, and wartime brotherhood. From the rescuing of downed pilots to taking out enemy positions, to the most harrowing extended missions directly overhead of the NVA, here is the dedication, courage and skill of the fliers who took the war into the enemy’s backyard.",['Tom Yarborough'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oTDJAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=oTDJAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT14&dq=Fly+the+Friendly+Skies+of+Laos&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2013-11-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oTDJAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],1.0

Based on the authors' extensive review of the literature, it provides a unified treatment of the most important results in the study of fractional graph concepts. Professors Scheinerman and Ullman begin by developing a general fractional theory of hypergraphs and move on to provide in-depth coverage of fundamental and advanced topics, including fractional matching, fractional coloring, and fractional edge coloring; fractional arboricity via matroid methods; and fractional isomorphism. The final chapter is devoted to a variety of additional issues, such as fractional topological graph theory, fractional cycle double covers, fractional domination, fractional intersection number, and fractional aspects of partially ordered sets. Supplemented with many challenging exercises in each chapter as well as an abundance of references and bibliographic material, Fractional Graph Theory is a comprehensive reference for researchers and an excellent graduate-level text for students of graph theory and linear programming.","['Professor Edward R Scheinerman', 'Edward R.

Schleiermacher: Abingdon Pillars of Theology (Series),"Theology Abingdon Pillars of Theology is a series for the college and seminary classroom designed to help students grasp the basic and necessary facts, influence, and significance of major theologians. Written by major scholars, these books outline the context, methodology, organizing principles, method, primary contributions, and major writings of people who have shaped theology as we know it today. Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834) is the father of modern theology. In an implicit dialogue with the reader, Terrence Tice demonstrates that Schleiermacher is also very much our contemporary struggling with the same questions we do today: What has God done for us all in Christ? and How should I respond? ""Schleiermacher defined the task of Christian theology as that of explaining the fact of 'the Word made flesh' AND the experience of it. This timely and enjoyable book is a most welcome and vitally important contribution to the contemporary Schleiermacher renaissance.""

Readers will especially welcome the author's insights on translating Schleiermacher's precise but conceptually elusive vocabulary into modern English. Indeed, it would not be too much to say that Tice has made Schleiermacher's own voice audible to a new generation."" Dawn DeVries, John Newton Thomas Professor of Systematic Theology, Union Theological Seminary and Presbyterian School of Christian Education ""Building on his own command of Schleiermacher's work, Terrence Tice distills decades of research into a clear and compact introduction. The book's thoughtful interpretation will engender knowledge--and even love--of Schleiermacher in readers. In addition readers will find the index a helpful and necessary companion to the English translations of Schleiermacher's works.""

Safety Last: The Dangers of Commerical Aviation; an Indictment by an Airline Pilot,"*THIS IS THE REPUBLISHED VERSION. THE ORIGINAL VERSION WAS PUBLISHED IN 1972. THIS VERSION DOES NOT CONTAIN ADDITIONAL OR NEW INFORMATION. The author of this eye-opening expose is a scheduled jet airline captain, as well as a fighter pilot in the Air Force Reserve, with twenty years of professional flying experience. Writing from the standpoint of a view of a pilot, he covers every aspect of commercial aviation and brings the reader to the conclusion that it is a much more perilous means of transportation than generally suspected. You will learn how poorly equipped most of our airports are; how the airlines write their own safety regulations and then succeed in evading even those requirements. You will find out what goes on on the flight deck and the dangers inherent in even the most routine shuttle flights. The author examines crash investigations, he take you on spine-tingling reconstructions of disasters you probably read about, and he reveals the often shocking truth of what really went wrong as opposed to what you may have read in the papers. ********** ""Safety Last by Captain Brian Power-Waters courageously describes real life in the airline industry and sounds the alarm for urgently needed reforms. It documents the abysmal performance of the Federal Aviation Administration in enforcing air safety standards and the shocking insensitivity of many airline officials. This book should be read by any airline passenger, executive, regulator or legislator who is concerned about protecting human life and safety in air travel."" Reuben Robertson III, Director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project and Aide to Ralph Nader ********** ""Captain Power-Waters unloads his list of complaints against commercial aviation without hedging and draws a frightening picture of chaos, carelessness and petty internecine warfare within the industry. The literate air traveler who gets his hands on this book may want to swear off forever. . . . Captain Power-Waters hits with authority."" Publishers Weekly ********** ""Fortunately, most of the flying public is unaware that many in airline management place a greater emphasis on making profits than on adhering to safety regulations. I compliment you on providing us with a damn fine insight into many of the problems which have been either overlooked or purposely evaded. I strongly concur in your book's closing observation that the real key to airline safety must be through a better utilization of the expertise of the pilot and the controller, who know flying best. These men are indebted to you for your daring to buck the tide, and call it as you see it."" From a letter to Captain Power-Waters from John F. Leyden, President, Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization ********** ""Safety Last is a fascinating and sobering journey into the realities of commercial aviation. It vividly describes the hazards of non-professionalism in our industry. The reader will also see the critical importance of professional aircraft maintenance along with the need for a more imaginative and aggressive FAA establishment. . . . Captain Power-Waters has courageously assailed the FAA-approved Minimum Equipment List and exposed it for what it is . . . a killer of airline passengers.""

The Emperor's Virtual Clothes: The Naked Truth About Internet Culture,"A skeptic by nature, a writer and teacher more at home with ballpoint pens than computer programs, Dinty W. Moore wanted to find out for himself if the much-touted Internet and the electronic culture it has spawned is really going to be the Next Big Thing, or whether it's the emperor's new clothes. This is not a how-to guide, a giddy net-head's online magical mystery tour, or a binaries-in-the-sky futurist treatise. Instead, this book tells it like it is about the Internet. Anyone who's asked, Who's there? What am I missing? and What is it all about? will find Moore's good-natured skepticism a welcome break from the explosion of wide-eyed techno-hype raging all around us. ""Moore is far and away the best pure writer of the 'Wired School.' He's like the Stage Manager poking his head in around the set of 'Our Town.'

The Nature of Natural History,"This classic work is an exploration of what natural history is, and a sustained effort to see how it relates to other areas of biology. Marston Bates did not attempt to overwhelm his audience with facts or overinterpret those he did use, and, perhaps for this reason, The Nature of Natural History is a timeless work. The author's genuine interest in the tropics has a very current feeling, and the first ten or fifteen chapters of the work have a style that is parallel to that of David Attenborough's verbal presentations of nature. From the book: ""I have already made several remarks about the connection between parasitism and degeneracy. I suspect this is a matter of point of view. We are predatory animals ourselves, and consequently admire the characteristics of predationagility, speed, cunning, self-reliance. We feel a certain kinship with the lion, and regard the liver fluke with horror. If a sheep were given the choice, though, it might prefer to be debilitated by liver flukes rather than killed by a lion."" Originally published in 1990. The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions.

Young Boudicca,"There have been many books written, and much research carried out, about this Queen, who is so well revered by this country, and held up as a figure to be admired and remembered for all time, that she has a statue in her honour in Westminster, London. Boudicca had her kingdom cruelly taken from her by the occupying Roman forces, when her husband died. We have a few paragraphs, written by a Roman, named ‘Tacitus’ which tells us how Boudicca was invited to a meeting with the Romans, which she thought was to welcome her as the Queen of the Iceni. She did not receive the hospitality she expected, and the treatment that she, and her daughters received, are believed to be the trigger for what happened next. The Romans under-estimated the strength and grit of Boudicca and the fanatical support of her people, and came to regret their actions. The book tells the story of Boudicca’s campaign to reclaim her kingdom. Written to inform the reader about the way of life of the ancient Britons, it tells how the occupying Roman forces ruled them. How Boudicca inspired her tribesmen and led them in a campaign that saw the destruction of Colchester, London and St Albans.",['Richard Scholefield'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tUQyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=tUQyEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT131&dq=Young+Boudicca&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,AuthorHouse,2021-05-26,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tUQyEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

INVESTING SUCCESS,"Daniel Crosby offers an accessible and applied take on a discipline that has long tended toward theory at the expense of the practical. Readers are treated to real, actionable guidance as the promise of behavioral finance is realised and practical applications for everyday investors are delivered. Crosby presents a framework of timeless principles for managing your behavior and your investing process. He begins by outlining ten rules that are the hallmarks of good investor behavior, including 'Forecasting is for Weathermen' and 'If You're Excited, It's Probably a Bad Idea'. He then goes on to introduce a unique new taxonomy of behavioral investment risk that will enable investors and academics alike to understand behavioral risk in a newly coherent and complete way. From here, attention turns to the four ways in which behavioral risk can be combatted and the five equity selection methods investors should harness to take advantage of behaviorally-induced opportunities in the stock market.",['Daniel Crosby'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vftcEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=vftcEAAAQBAJ&dq=INVESTING+SUCCESS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harriman House,2016,http://books.google.com/books?id=vftcEAAAQBAJ&dq=INVESTING+SUCCESS&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],

Rule #1: Don't ever attract their attention. But it's too late. Keenan is the Summer King who has sought his queen for nine centuries. Without her, summer itself will perish. He is determined that Aislinn will become the Summer Queen at any cost—regardless of her plans or desires. Suddenly none of the rules that have kept Aislinn safe are working anymore, and everything is on the line: her freedom, her best friend Seth, her life—everything.",['Melissa Marr'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M7a0asTZ9LAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=M7a0asTZ9LAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Eternity,+My+Beloved+(International+Series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Harper Collins,2009-10-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M7a0asTZ9LAC&source=gbs_api,['Young Adult Fiction'],223.0

Strip Show: Performances of Gender and Desire (Gender in Performance),"This book offers an account of an unprecedented North American study of contemporary female and male strip shows. It particularly focuses on the contradictory sex roles, cultural positions, and performance practices of 'straight' strip shows during their second heyday in the early 1990s. Katherine Liepe-Levinson's research took her to over seventy different strip bars, clubs, theatres and sex emporiums ranging from elaborate lap-dancing and couch-dancing 'gentlemen's' clubs in New York, Houston, and San Francisco; to Peoria's onetime duplex cabaret where women strip for men downstairs, and men for women upstairs; to the nightclubs of Montreal where female and male performers displayed the 'Full Monty'. Liepe-Levinson's intriguing, comprehensive study concentrates on the cultural and theatrical elements of the strip shows themselves including the geographic locations and interior designs of the clubs, the choreography and costumes of the dancers and the all-important participation of the audience. She draws upon a variety of methodologies as well as interviews with performers to explore how the strip show's cultural and theatrical aspects simultaneously uphold and break traditional sex roles. Her findings readily complicate several of the most prominent and prevalent theories about sexual representation, gender and desire.",['Katherine Liepe-Levinson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I-iFAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=I-iFAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Strip+Show:+Performances+of+Gender+and+Desire+(Gender+in+Performance)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2003-09-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I-iFAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Performing Arts'],

"Lift Us Up: Poetry of Patience and Healing, A Gift Book","""Flicker is a memoir in verse of a life well lived. Lynn Hansen rightly names the collection for her favorite bird, and for the flickers, or moments, of happenings caught in words, illustrating phases and interests of a lifetime. She carries us through childhood's joys of ""forest humus, thick moss / and a bouquet of wild orchids"" and woes, ""the word move was profane because it frees the rat of anxiety that gnaws on the tight knot in my gut."" She rejoices when she declares, ""When I retire I'm going to write poetry."" Then for a decade or more, that's precisely what she has done. Lynn was determined to be a scientist in a time it was regarded as impossible for women; her thirty-three-year career of teaching biological sciences at the college level has proven her right. Her keen naturalist's eye, her awareness and love of all life on this planet, and beyond, show in her poems. She even celebrates the lowly zucchini and rutabaga, though she does sigh toward the end of summer, ""Zucchini manna again?"" These observations are woven into the sum of time, the treasure of relationships, ""just as our lives gathered out of jumble, then cemented with a matrix of mutual respect."" Lynn's lone robin ""lifts his bugle beak to call up morning,"" and so lifts us all."" -Patricia Wellingham-Jones, Los Molinos, California ""This collection by Lynn M. Hansen is an excellent read. While each poem is intensely personal, moving from childhood experiences to motherhood to traveling the world to growing older, Hansen generously takes us along on all her journeys, creating poems that welcome all comers. Her close observations of the natural world, of lands both distant and close to home, create a landscape at once scientifically clear and poetically imagined, and her poems about growing up and getting older and the joys and losses that come with those parts of our lives, will make readers laugh and cry, sometimes all at once. In reading this book, I grew to even more deeply appreciate our world, our Great Central Valley, and Lynn Hansen's poetry, and I suspect the same will be true for all who read this celebratory work."" -Gillian Wegener, Poet Laureate of Modesto, California. ""Lynn Hansen's gorgeous book of poems is a testament to a writer who loves life and fully embraces living every day. It's rare that a trained scientist will turn to poetry to reflect on the natural world and even rarer that those written poems would be this wonderfully lucid, evocative, and heartfelt. Filled with keen-eyed wonder and amusement, these poems will teach readers about life and how to live."" -Sam Pierstorff, Editor, Quercus Review Press",['Lynn M.

Foreign Bodies and the Body Politic: Discourses of Social Pathology in Early Modern England (Cambridge Studies in Renaissance Literature and Culture),"Jonathan Gil Harris examines the origins of modern discourses of social pathology in Elizabethan and Jacobean medical and political writing. Plays, pamphlets and political treatises of this period display an increasingly xenophobic tendency to attribute England's ills to 'foreign bodies' such as Jews, Catholics and witches, as well as treat their allegedly 'poisonous' features for the health of the body politic. Harris argues that this tendency resonates with two of the distinctive paradigms of Paracelsus' pharmacy which also includes the notion that poison has a medicinal power. The emergence of these paradigms in early modern English political thought signals a decisive shift from Galenic humoral tradition towards twentieth-century politico-medical discourses of 'infection' and 'containment', which, like their early modern predecessors, make mysterious the domestic origins of social conflict and the operations of political authority.",['Jonathan Gil Harris'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x0IXc2e_7GIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=x0IXc2e_7GIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Foreign+Bodies+and+the+Body+Politic:+Discourses+of+Social+Pathology+in+Early+Modern+England+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Renaissance+Literature+and+Culture)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,1998-05-07,http://books.google.com/books?id=x0IXc2e_7GIC&dq=Foreign+Bodies+and+the+Body+Politic:+Discourses+of+Social+Pathology+in+Early+Modern+England+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Renaissance+Literature+and+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

"Tax Revolt: The Rebellion Against an Overbearing, Bloated, Arrogant, and Abusive Government","Ever since the Boston Tea Party, courageous and patriotic citizens have rebelled against the government's overbearing and abusive taxation of its constituents. This book is the powerful rallying cry to all Americans to continue to fight against our ever-increasing taxes. Using as a touchstone the heroic incident in Tennessee, when citizens converged on the state capitol to protest and repeatedly beat back attempts to pass a state tax, Valentine weaves an inspiring story of how patriotic citizens have stood up to taxes in the past, how many intrepid constituents continue to fight, and how Americans should resist and even revolt against taxes on a state and national level. By exploring the crippling effects of taxes on our economy and the lives of each individual citizen and drawing from the stories of other revolts (with exclusive behind-the-scenes details about the Tennessee rebellion), Valentine will anger and incite readers to action, giving them the motivation and know-how to spread the word and activate a powerful new revolution.",['Phil Valentine'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_AkWMXlWy04C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=_AkWMXlWy04C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Tax+Revolt:+The+Rebellion+Against+an+Overbearing,+Bloated,+Arrogant,+and+Abusive+Government&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Thomas Nelson Inc,2005-03-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_AkWMXlWy04C&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],1.0

"Big Gifts For Small Groups: A 1-hour Board Member's Guide To Securing Gifts Of $500 To $5,000","If yours is among the tens of thousands of organizations for whom six- and seven-figure gifts are unattainable, then Andy Robinson's' new book, Big Gifts for Small Groups, is just the ticket for you and your board.The subtitle, A Board Member's 1-Hour Guide to Securing Gifts of $500 to $5,000 says it all. Robinson is the straightest of shooters ? a sort of John McCain of fundraising. There literally isn't one piece of advice in this book that's glib or inauthentic. It has all been earned. But, then again, what would you expect from a fellow who first won his stripes as door to door canvasser, making 10,000 pitches on 10,000 doorsteps.As a result of Robinson's 'no bull' style, board members will take immediately to Big Gifts for Small Groups, confident the author isn't slinging unrealistic bromides.They'll learn everything they need to know from this one-hour read: how to get ready for the campaign, who to approach, where to find them; where to conduct the meeting, what to bring with you, how to ask, how to make it easy for the donor to give, what to do once you have the commitment ? even how to convey your thanks in a memorable way.Believing that other books already focus on higher sum gifts, the author smartly targets a range that has been neglected: $500 to $5,000. Why? Here's what Robinson says:o They're large enough to justify the time it takes to develop a prospect list, prepare a letter, follow up with a phone call and visit the prospective donor.o They're small enough to include a wide range of prospects. o They're both modest enough to seem feasible to the novice, but also ambitious enough to make it worth their while.o Taken in the context of a major gifts campaign, with a team of solicitors working together, gifts of $500 to $5,000 can add up to a lot of money.Robinson has a penchant for good writing and for using exactly the right example or anecdote to illustrate his point. But more importantly he lets his no-nonsense personality shine through. The result being that by the end of the book, your board members just may turn to one another and say, ""Hey, we can do this"" ? and mean it.",['Andy Robinson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3WUSiEE7newC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=3WUSiEE7newC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Big+Gifts+For+Small+Groups:+A+1-hour+Board+Member%27s+Guide+To+Securing+Gifts+Of+%24500+To+%245,000&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","Emerson & Church, Publishers",2004,"http://books.google.com/books?id=3WUSiEE7newC&dq=Big+Gifts+For+Small+Groups:+A+1-hour+Board+Member%27s+Guide+To+Securing+Gifts+Of+%24500+To+%245,000&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Business & Economics'],

Kiss Tomorrow Hello: Notes from the Midlife Underground by Twenty-five Women over Forty,"“How could ‘old age’ be a medical diagnosis when I wasn’t even forty?” —Lolly Winston “… if aging is difficult for those of us who were only sometimes cute,” she says, “just imagine how hard it must be for the aging knockouts, the living dolls.” —Rebecca McClanahan “I love sex. I love middle-age sex. I love married sex. I'm almost fifty and I've never felt sexier. But damn, it took a long time to get here.” —Ellen Sussman “And who is that woman who looks just like me in the mirror behind the bar? Could she be some evil twin, sitting in a place I’d never go alone, acting like a hanger-on, a groupie?” —Lisa Norris “… even past sixty (perhaps especially past sixty), women like me feel impelled to stick to the myths we have invented for ourselves.” —Annick Smith “Slow down. Don’t be so frenetic. Contemplate on the insights you have gained. Listen to the silence within.” —Bharti Kirchner “The young woman’s body I live inside still, that unforgotten home, is a text. It is engraved with memory …” —Meredith Hall A collection of blazingly honest, smart, and often humorous essays on middle age contributed by well-known writers such as Julia Glass, Joyce Maynard, Lolly Winston, Antonya Nelson, Diana Abu-Jaber, Judy Blunt, Lauren Slater, and other voices of the baby boom generation. In the tradition of the bestselling A Bitch in the House, Kiss Tomorrow Hello brings together the experiences and reflections of women as they embark on a new stage of life. Many women in their forties, fifties, and sixties discover that they are racing uphill, trying desperately to keep their romantic and social lives afloat just as those things they believe constant start to shift: The body begins its inevitable decline, sometimes gracefully, sometimes less so… The twenty-five stellar writers gathered here explore a wide range of concerns, including keeping love (and sex) alive, discovering family secrets, negotiating the demands of illness and infertility, letting children go, making peace with parents, and contemplating plastic surgery. The tales are true, the confessions candid, and the humor infectious—just what you’d expect from the women whose works represent the best writings of their generation. From Lynn Freed’s wry “Happy Birthday to Me” to Pam Houston’s hilarious “Coffee Dates with a Beefcake”; from Ellen Sussman's ""Tearing Up the Sheets"" to Julia Glass's ""I Have a Crush on Ted Geisel,"" Kiss Tomorrow Hello is a wise, lyrical, and sexy look at the pleasures and perils of midlife.","['Kim Barnes', 'Claire Davis']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hzES3hRB-xUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=hzES3hRB-xUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Kiss+Tomorrow+Hello:+Notes+from+the+Midlife+Underground+by+Twenty-five+Women+over+Forty&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Doubleday,2006-03-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hzES3hRB-xUC&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],1.0

The Bostonians,"This early work by Henry James was originally published in 1886 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography. Henry James was born in New York City in 1843. One of thirteen children, James had an unorthodox early education, switching between schools, private tutors and private reading.. James published his first story, ‘A Tragedy of Error’, in the Continental Monthly in 1864, when he was twenty years old. In 1876, he emigrated to London, where he remained for the vast majority of the rest of his life, becoming a British citizen in 1915. From this point on, he was a hugely prolific author, eventually producing twenty novels and more than a hundred short stories and novellas, as well as literary criticism, plays and travelogues. Amongst James's most famous works are The Europeans (1878), Daisy Miller (1878), Washington Square (1880), The Bostonians (1886), and one of the most famous ghost stories of all time, The Turn of the Screw (1898).

Desperate to grant her mother's dying wish, Sariana suddenly finds herself seeking that which she has been running from for years: commitment and marriage. Gavin Matthews, a man from Sariana's past, resurfaces with wishes of his own. Out of loneliness and desire for attachment to someone, Gavin agrees to enter a marriage of convenience to Sari with the stipulation that they will divorce after Sari's mother passes. Very quickly, however, hearts get involved-or rather, one heart gets involved.

"From Here, You Can't See Paris : Seasons of a French Village and Its Restaurant","From Here,You Can't See Paris is a sweet, leisurely exploration of the life of Les Arques (population 159), a hilltop village in a remote corner of France untouched by the modern era. It is a story of a dying village's struggle to survive, of a dead artist whose legacy began its rebirth, and of chef Jacques Ratier and his wife, Noëlle, whose bustling restaurant -- the village's sole business -- has helped ensure Les Arques's future. Sanders set out to explore the inner workings of a French restaurant kitchen but ended up stumbling into a much richer world. Through the eyes of the Sanders family, one discovers the vibrant traditions of food, cooking, and rural living, and comes to know the village's history. Whether uncovering the darker secrets of making foie gras, hearing a chef confess his doubts about the Michelin star system, or absorbing the lore of the land around a farmhouse kitchen table after a boar hunt, life in Les Arques turns out to be anything but sleepy.",['Michael S.

This is the diary he kept of that tour; a study of triumphs, failures and mindbending chaos as cast and crew ambitiously attempt to steer the production from the snows of Pittsburgh to the glory of the 'Great White Way', arriving on Broadway to coincide with the horrific events of 9/11. Packed with theatrical anecdotes, gossip and Jarvis' wry observations on culture shock and the theatre world, Broadway, Jeeves? is a heady mixture of comedy and drama.

Keywords: A vocabulary of culture and society,"First published in 1976, Raymond Williams' highly acclaimed Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society is a collection of lively essays on words that are critical to understanding the modern world. In these essays, Williams, a renowned cultural critic, demonstrates how these key words take on new meanings and how these changes reflect the political bent and values of our past and current society. He chose words both essential and intangible--words like nature, underprivileged, industry, liberal, violence, to name a few--and, by tracing their etymology and evolution, grounds them in a wider political and cultural framework. The result is an illuminating account of the central vocabulary of ideological debate in English in the modern period. This edition features a new original foreword by Colin MacCabe, Distinguished Professor of English and Literature, University of Pittsburgh, that reflects on the significance of Williams' life and work. Keywords remains as relevant today as it was over thirty years ago, offering a provocative study of our language and an insightful look at the society in which we live.",['Raymond Williams'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E4PnCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=E4PnCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Keywords:+A+vocabulary+of+culture+and+society&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,2014,http://books.google.com/books?id=E4PnCwAAQBAJ&dq=Keywords:+A+vocabulary+of+culture+and+society&hl=&source=gbs_api,['LANGUAGE ARTS & DISCIPLINES'],

SURRENDER,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “Imaginative and fulfilling . . . an addictive contemporary crime procedural.”—Michael Connelly, The New York Times Book Review (Editors’ Choice) Caleb Carr, the author of The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness, returns with a contemporary, edge-of-your-seat thriller featuring the brilliant but unconventional criminal psychologist Dr. Trajan Jones. In the small town of Surrender in upstate New York, Dr. Jones, a psychological profiler, and Dr. Michael Li, a trace evidence expert, teach online courses in profiling and forensic science from Jones’s family farm. Once famed advisors to the New York City Police Department, Trajan and Li now work in exile, having made enemies of those in power. Protected only by farmhands and Jones’s unusual “pet,” the outcast pair is unexpectedly called in to consult on a disturbing case. In rural Burgoyne County, a pattern of strange deaths has emerged: adolescent boys and girls are found murdered in gruesome fashion. Senior law enforcement officials are quick to blame a serial killer, yet their efforts to apprehend this criminal are peculiarly ineffective. Jones and Li soon discover that the victims are all “throwaway children,” a new state classification of young people who are neither orphans, runaways, nor homeless, but who are abandoned by their families and left to fend for themselves. Two of these throwaways, Lucas Kurtz and his older sister, Ambyr, cross paths with Jones and Li, offering information that could blow the case wide open. As the stakes grow higher, Jones and Li must not only unravel the mystery of how the throwaways died but also defend themselves and the Kurtz siblings against shadowy agents who don’t want the truth to get out. Jones believes the real story leads back to the city where both he and Dr. Kreizler did their greatest work. But will Jones and Li be able to trace the case to New York before they fall victim to the murderous forces that stalk them? Tautly paced and richly researched, Surrender, New York brings to life the grim underbelly of a prosperous nation—and those most vulnerable to its failings. This brilliant novel marks another milestone in Caleb Carr’s triumphant literary suspense career. Praise for Surrender, New York “[A] page-turning thriller . . . For maximum enjoyment: surrender, reader.”—The Wall Street Journal “Every word of fiction Carr has produced seems to have been written in either direct or indirect conversation with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. . . .

As in The Alienist, Carr triumphs at every twist and turn.”—Providence Journal “Edgar Allan Poe would have understood this book and hailed it a masterpiece. . . .

Religion in a Free Society,"The intellectual and political elite of the West is nowadays taking for granted that religion, in particular Christianity, is a cultural vestige, a primitive form of knowledge, a consolation for the poor minded, an obstacle to coexistence. In all influential environments, the widespread watchword is “We are all secular” or “We are all post-religious.” As a consequence, we are told that states must be independent of religious creed, politics must take a neutral stance regarding religious values, and societies must hold together without any reference to religious bonds. Liberalism, which in some form or another is the prevailing view in the West, is considered to be “free-standing,” and the Western, liberal, open society is taken to be “self-sufficient.” Not only is anti-Christian secularism wrong, it is also risky. It's wrong because the very ideas on which liberal societies are based and in terms of which they can be justified—the concept of the dignity of the human person, the moral priority of the individual, the view that man is a “crooked timber” inclined to prevarication, the limited confidence in the power of the state to render him virtuous—are typical Christian or, more precisely, Judeo-Christian ideas. Take them away and the open society will collapse. Anti-Christian secularism is risky because it jeopardizes the identity of the West, leaves it with no self-conscience, and deprives people of their sense of belonging. The Founding Fathers of America, as well as major intellectual European figures such as Locke, Kant, and Tocqueville, knew how much our civilization depends on Christianity. Today, American and European culture is shaking the pillars of that civilization. Written from a secular and liberal, but not anti-Christian, point of view, this book explains why the Christian culture is still the best antidote to the crisis and decline of the West. Pera proposes that we should call ourselves Christians if we want to maintain our liberal freedoms, to embark on such projects as the political unification of Europe as well as the special relationship between Europe and America, and to avoid the relativistic trend that affects our public ethics. “The challenges of our particular historical moment”, as Pope Benedict XVI calls them in the Preface to the book, can be faced only if we stress the historical and conceptual link between Christianity and free society.",['Marcello Pera'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LGVzcUQbMhwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LGVzcUQbMhwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Religion+in+a+Free+Society&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Encounter Books,2011,http://books.google.com/books?id=LGVzcUQbMhwC&dq=Religion+in+a+Free+Society&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

Variaciones en rojo / Red Variations (Spanish Edition),"In this expertly crafted, richly detailed guide, Raymond Leslie Williams explores the cultural, political, and historical events that have shaped the Latin American and Caribbean novel since the end of World War II. In addition to works originally composed in English, Williams covers novels written in Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, and Haitian Creole, and traces the profound influence of modernization, revolution, and democratization on the writing of this era. Beginning in 1945, Williams introduces major trends by region, including the Caribbean and U.S. Latino novel, the Mexican and Central American novel, the Andean novel, the Southern Cone novel, and the novel of Brazil. He discusses the rise of the modernist novel in the 1940s, led by Jorge Luis Borges's reaffirmation of the right of invention, and covers the advent of the postmodern generation of the 1990s in Brazil, the Generation of the ""Crack"" in Mexico, and the McOndo generation in other parts of Latin America. An alphabetical guide offers biographies of authors, coverage of major topics, and brief introductions to individual novels. It also addresses such areas as women's writing, Afro-Latin American writing, and magic realism. The guide's final section includes an annotated bibliography of introductory studies on the Latin American and Caribbean novel, national literary traditions, and the work of individual authors. From early attempts to synthesize postcolonial concerns with modernist aesthetics to the current focus on urban violence and globalization, The Columbia Guide to the Latin American Novel Since 1945 presents a comprehensive, accessible portrait of a thoroughly diverse and complex branch of world literature.","['Raymond L.

"Maskerade (Discworld, Book 18)","'There's a kind of magic in masks. Masks conceal one face, but they reveal another. The one that only comes out in darkness . . .' The Opera House in Ankh-Morpork is home to music, theatrics and a harmless masked Ghost who lurks behind the scenes. But now a set of mysterious backstage murders may just stop the show. Agnes Nitt has left her rural home of Lancre in the hopes of launching a successful singing career in the big city. The only problem is, she doesn't quite look the part. And there are two witches who would much rather she return home to join their coven. Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg have travelled to Ankh-Morpork to convince Agnes that life as a witch is much better than one on the stage.

Chokecherry Places: Essays from the High Plains,"In this new book detailing his travels through the American Great Plains, author Merrill Gilfillan continues to elucidate for us, and add to our appreciation of, one of the most ignored and misunderstood areas of our vast American landscape. Like few American writers, Gilfillan has a deep feeling for, and understanding of the western grasslands, which give both dignity and a deep historical sense to our sometimes forgotten heartland.Gilfillan's sense of the land encompasses the plants, wildflowers, and small creatures; the birds that he writes such wonderfully detailed descriptions about; the rivers, watering holes, and butteframed vistas; and, very importantly, the legacy of the Plains tribes of Native Americans who loved this land and fashioned myth and legend about it. By overlaying these myths onto the modern plains landscape, Gilfillan invokes a poignant sense of loss, yet we are also ennobled by the profound sense of the landscape that his vision imparts to us. Gilfillan is a tour guide like no other. His readers are given lovely, lingering descriptions of the overlooked and forgotten, the out-of-the-way and underfoot.",['Merrill Gilfillan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Aghj6zfaeK0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Aghj6zfaeK0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Chokecherry+Places:+Essays+from+the+High+Plains&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Big Earth Publishing,1998,http://books.google.com/books?id=Aghj6zfaeK0C&dq=Chokecherry+Places:+Essays+from+the+High+Plains&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],

Japanese gardens are rooted in two traditions: an indigenous prehistoric tradition in which patches of graveled forest or pebbled beach were dedicated to nature spirits, and a tradition from China and Korea that included elements such as ponds, streams, waterfalls, rock compositions and a variety of vegetation. The Art of the Japanese Garden traces the development and blending of these two traditions, as well as the inclusion of new features as gardening reached new heights of sophistication on Japanese soil. 300 full-color Japanese garden illustrations and photographs highlight notable gardens in Japan, including graveled courtyards, early aristocratic gardens, esoteric and paradise gardens, Zen gardens, warrior gardens, tea gardens and stroll gardens.

Fort wrote ten novels, though only one, The Outcast Manufacturers was published in 1909 and was later serialized in the American edition of Pearson's Magazine. Only five chapters were published in Pearson's. Understanding Fort's books takes time and effort: his style is complex, violent and poetic, profound and occasionally puzzling. Ideas are abandoned and then recalled a few pages on; examples and data are offered, compared and contrasted, conclusions made and broken, as Fort holds up the unorthodox to the scrutiny of the orthodoxy that continually fails to account for them. Pressing on his attacks, Fort shows what he sees as the ridiculousness of the conventional explanations and then interjects with his own theories.

Women in the Middle Ages (The Image of woman),"Reissued for the first time in decades, this ambitious work of Medieval scholarship by bestselling historians Frances and Joseph Gies traces the stories and fates of women in Medieval Europe over the course of a millennium. Medieval history is often written as a series of battles and territorial shifts. But the essential contributions of women during this period have been too often relegated to the dustbin of history. In Women in the Middle Ages, Frances and Joseph Gies reclaim this lost history, in a lively historical survey that charts the evolution of women’s roles throughout the period, and profiles eight individual women in depth. We learn of Hildegarde of Bingen, an abbess who was a noted composer and founded two monasteries; of Eleanor de Montfort, a 13th century Princess of Wales who was captured by Edward I and held as a political prisoner for three years; and women of somewhat more modest means, such as the spouse of an Italian merchant, and a peasant’s wife. Drawing upon their various stories, talented historians Frances and Joseph Gies—whose books were used by George R.R. Martin in his research for Game of Thrones—offer a kaleidoscopic view of the lives of women throughout this tumultuous period. “A wealth of solid information.” –New York Times","['Joseph Gies', 'Frances Gies']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xk0Isx13hjUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Xk0Isx13hjUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Women+in+the+Middle+Ages+(The+Image+of+woman)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2010-11-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xk0Isx13hjUC&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],1.0
Dead Low Tide,"Dead Low Tide is an iconic early thriller from John D. MacDonald, the mastermind behind Cape Fear and the Travis McGee novels. On the coast of Florida, a working stiff is wrongfully accused of murdering his boss—and must outwit one of MacDonald’s signature villains to save his life. Introduction by Dean Koontz A college graduate and amateur fisherman, Andy McClintock is stuck toiling in the office of a construction company. But when Andy tries to quit, his boss offers him a promotion and a raise—and then promptly kills himself with a harpoon gun. At least, that’s what it looks like, until the police rule it homicide—with the murder weapon belonging to Andy. The harpoon gun had been stolen out of Andy’s garage, and the boss’s wife makes the outrageous claim that she and Andy were having an affair. He’s been set up. To clear his name, he’ll have to find the real killer. But Andy soon discovers that he’s up against more than a two-bit thief—he’s been targeted by absolute evil, a monster with no compassion for his fellow man. Praise for John D. MacDonald and Dead Low Tide “John D. MacDonald was the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller.”—Stephen King “The writing is marked by sharp observation, vivid dialogue, and a sense of sweet warm horror.”—The New York Times “To diggers a thousand years from now, the works of John D. MacDonald would be a treasure on the order of the tomb of Tutankhamen.”—Kurt Vonnegut",['John D.

The Mechanization of the Mind,"An examination of the fundamental role cybernetics played in the birth of cognitive science and the light this sheds on current controversies. The conceptual history of cognitive science remains for the most part unwritten. In this groundbreaking book, Jean-Pierre Dupuy—one of the principal architects of cognitive science in France—provides an important chapter: the legacy of cybernetics. Contrary to popular belief, Dupuy argues, cybernetics represented not the anthropomorphization of the machine but the mechanization of the human. The founding fathers of cybernetics—some of the greatest minds of the twentieth century, including John von Neumann, Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, and Walter Pitts—intended to construct a materialist and mechanistic science of mental behavior that would make it possible at last to resolve the ancient philosophical problem of mind and matter. The importance of cybernetics to cognitive science, Dupuy argues, lies not in its daring conception of the human mind in terms of the functioning of a machine but in the way the strengths and weaknesses of the cybernetics approach can illuminate controversies that rage today—between cognitivists and connectionists, eliminative materialists and Wittgensteinians, functionalists and anti-reductionists. Dupuy brings to life the intellectual excitement that attended the birth of cognitive science sixty years ago. He separates the promise of cybernetic ideas from the disappointment that followed as cybernetics was rejected and consigned to intellectual oblivion. The mechanization of the mind has reemerged today as an all-encompassing paradigm in the convergence of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science. The tensions, contradictions, paradoxes, and confusions Dupuy discerns in cybernetics offer a cautionary tale for future developments in cognitive science.",['Jean-Pierre Dupuy'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gDoiEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=gDoiEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Mechanization+of+the+Mind&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,MIT Press,2009-04-17,http://books.google.com/books?id=gDoiEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Mechanization+of+the+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Computers'],1.0

The Scarlet Lily,"?This is the colorful story of the opening of Western Canada in 1860 as seen through the eyes of Ellen Nash--a beautiful, well-mannered, and musically talented young woman brought up in the East. She marries a missionary Indian, David Hunter, who is attempting to educate his tribesmen and the white settlers to understand each other’s needs and ways of doing things. On one of these expeditions David is killed. Some time later Ellen marries Bruce Cameron. The exciting political and social life of each community where Ellen lives--Indian camp, trading post, small town and later the cattle ranch and the national capital--is described in intimate detail. The story weaves back and forth between the personal life of Ellen and the dramatic events that affect the settling of the Northwest Territories in Canada; the building of the railroad; the financial intrigues of which Ellen becomes aware through her second husband’s involvement; the reactions of the Indian tribes that had occupied these lands for centuries; the means used by the rum-runners and traders to subdue the Indians; the formation of the Northwest Mounted Police; and finally the various treaties signed by Queen Victoria’s representatives and by the chiefs of the several Indian tribes.?--Book jacket.",['Nan Shipley'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q9bUAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=q9bUAAAAMAAJ&q=The+Scarlet+Lily&dq=The+Scarlet+Lily&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,New York : F.

The Metaphor of God Incarnate,"In this groundbreaking work, John Hick refutes the traditional Christian understanding of Jesus of Nazareth. According to Hick, Jesus did not teach what was to become the orthodox understanding of him: that he was God incarnate who became human to die for the sins of the world. Further, the traditional dogma of Jesus' two natures--human and divine--cannot be explained satisfactorily, and worse, it has been used to justify great human evils. Thus, the divine incarnation, he explains, is best understood metaphorically. Nevertheless, he concludes that Christians can still understand Jesus as Lord and the one who has made God real to us.

Driving home this striking contemporary relevance of the famous Indian epic, Mahabharata Now focuses on the issues of narration, aesthetics and ethics, as also their interlinkages. The cross-disciplinary essays in the volume imaginatively re-interpret the ‘timeless’ classic in the light of the pre-modern Indian narrative styles, poetics, aesthetic codes, and moral puzzles; the Western theories on modern ethics, aesthetics, metaphysics, psychoanalysis, and philosophy of science; and the contemporary social, ethical and political concerns. The essays are all united in their effort to situate the Mahabharata in the context of here and now without violating the sanctity of the ‘written text’ as we have it today.

"Wreckage Begins with ""W"": Cartoons of the Bush Administration","JEFF DANZIGER IS an independent political cartoonist whose work appears in hundreds of newspapers around the world via the New York Times Syndicate. He draws from six to ten cartoons a week on a wide variety of subjects, from international folly to Hollywood hubris. An equal opportunity satirist, he is politically to the left of Genghis Kahn — everyone and everything is fair game. His dark drawings, pull-no-punches humor, and “Danziger” signature line are instantly recognizable to any regular reader of newspaper opinion pages. As with any great political humorist, Danziger’s funniest creations lampoon the most deadly serious subjects. Created in the heat of the moment and collected here for the first time, Danziger’s cartoons of George W. Bush’s ascent to the White House and first term in office amount to a highly entertaining excursion through the national and international political landscape of the past four years. Wreckage Begins with “W” showcases a singular wit and an artist of uncanny prescience.","['Jeff Danziger', 'Frank Miller']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oxECAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=oxECAAAACAAJ&dq=Wreckage+Begins+with+%22W%22:+Cartoons+of+the+Bush+Administration&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Steerforth Italia,2004,http://books.google.com/books?id=oxECAAAACAAJ&dq=Wreckage+Begins+with+%22W%22:+Cartoons+of+the+Bush+Administration&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Humor'],

Priestley: Political Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought),"Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) was arguably one of the most important and interesting English theorists to focus on the issue of political liberty during the English Enlightenment. His concept of freedom is of crucial importance to two of the major issues of his day: the right of dissenters to religious toleration, and the right of the American colonists to self-government. Despite the fundamental importance of both these themes in liberal political theory and their contemporary relevance to national self-determination, Priestley's writings lack a modern edition. This new collection will be the first to make accessible to students Priestleys' Essay on the First Principles and The Present State of Liberty, which encapsulate his political ideology. An introduction and notes, together with guides to further reading and key figures in the text provide the student with all the material necessary for approaching Priestley.","['Joseph Priestley', 'Priestley Joseph']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q6trui8a_7wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=q6trui8a_7wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Priestley:+Political+Writings+(Cambridge+Texts+in+the+History+of+Political+Thought)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,1993-06-03,http://books.google.com/books?id=q6trui8a_7wC&dq=Priestley:+Political+Writings+(Cambridge+Texts+in+the+History+of+Political+Thought)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

What Does Mrs. Freeman Want?,"While lying on the beach in Greece with an accommodating female companion, the narrator of this novel, Petros Abatzoglou (also the name of the author), describes the peculiar life story and marriage of Mrs. Freeman. By turns digressive, tender, humorous, and pedantic, the narrator's monologue is interrupted only when he wants something from his companion, usually another drink. In relating the story of Mrs. Freeman - a fiercely independent woman - the narrator exemplifies almost all the characteristics of a self-centered male. Obsessed with food, alcohol, and the need to be the center of a woman's attention, he paints a mental picture of the elusive Mrs. Freeman, and his own vision of the ""ideal"" woman.","['Petros Ampatzoglou', 'Kaiē Tsitselē']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MUq070DM15wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=MUq070DM15wC&pg=PA24&dq=What+Does+Mrs.+Freeman+Want%3F&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Dalkey Archive Press,2005,http://books.google.com/books?id=MUq070DM15wC&dq=What+Does+Mrs.+Freeman+Want%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1.0

"Notes on Scripture (The Works of Jonathan Edwards Series, Volume 15) (v. 15)","This is the first complete edition of the private biblical notebook that Jonathan Edwards compiled over a period of nearly thirty-five years. Edwards' ""Notes on Scripture"" confirms the centrality of the Bible in his thought and provides more balance to earlier depictions of his writings that emphasized the scientific and philosophical while overlooking the biblical dimension. In this critical edition the entries appear in the order in which Edwards wrote them, beginning with a short commentary on Genesis 2:10-14 that he penned in 1724, and ending with his last entry, Number 507 on the Book of Solomon's Song, written two years before his death. This volume provides direct access to one of America's most influential religious thinkers. Edwards' entries range across the entire scriptural canon and reveal his creativity in the interpretation of particular biblical texts and his fascination with typology. The notebook also documents Edwards' engagement with the intellectual currents of his day, in particular his response to the challenge associated with the Enlightenment critique of biblical revelation. Stephen J. Stein's introduction situates Edwards as an exegete in the larger tradition of biblical commentary and in the intellectual world of eighteenth-century Western thought.",['Jonathan Edwards'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yHImAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=yHImAQAAIAAJ&dq=Notes+on+Scripture+(The+Works+of+Jonathan+Edwards+Series,+Volume+15)+(v.+15)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",,1998,"http://books.google.com/books?id=yHImAQAAIAAJ&dq=Notes+on+Scripture+(The+Works+of+Jonathan+Edwards+Series,+Volume+15)+(v.+15)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Biography & Autobiography'],

Time and the Universe (Whats the Big Idea),"The most trusted explainer of the most mind-boggling concepts pulls back the veil of mystery that has too long cloaked the most valuable building blocks of modern science. Sean Carroll, with his genius for making complex notions entertaining, presents in his uniquely lucid voice the fundamental ideas informing the modern physics of reality. Physics offers deep insights into the workings of the universe but those insights come in the form of equations that often look like gobbledygook. Sean Carroll shows that they are really like meaningful poems that can help us fly over sierras to discover a miraculous multidimensional landscape alive with radiant giants, warped space-time, and bewilderingly powerful forces. High school calculus is itself a centuries-old marvel as worthy of our gaze as the Mona Lisa. And it may come as a surprise the extent to which all our most cutting-edge ideas about black holes are built on the math calculus enables. No one else could so smoothly guide readers to grasping the very equation Einstein used to describe his theory of general relativity. In the tradition of the legendary Richard Feynman lectures presented sixty years ago, this book is an inspiring, dazzling introduction to a way of seeing that will resonate across cultural and generational boundaries for many years to come.",['Sean Carroll'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3bFVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3bFVEAAAQBAJ&dq=Time+and+the+Universe+(Whats+the+Big+Idea)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2022-09-20,http://books.google.com/books?id=3bFVEAAAQBAJ&dq=Time+and+the+Universe+(Whats+the+Big+Idea)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Science'],

The Three Romes.,"."" Moscow, Constantinople (now Istanbul), and Rome itself are vitally alive in the present and are magnets for tourists. Also going back a long way, each lives in history. These cities have their points in common, each wanting to rule the world and establiRome of the Caesars, Constantinople of the Emperors, and Moscow of the Tsars were also the Rome of St. Peter, the Constantinople of the Patriarchs, and the Moscow of the Orthodox Metropolitans. These were cities on earth that aspired to heaven, kingdoms that succeeded each other as standard-bearers of Christianity from the fourth century on. Indeed, the Russian monk declared to the Tsar: ""Two Romes have fallen, but the third stands, and a fourth shall never besh the kingdom of heaven on earth. People, recognizing this, link them together as the Three Romes. These cities differ, though, in their understanding of man's nature and business. The Three Romes are three places and also states of mind. Now, with a new introduction which describes the contemporary significance to these cities this book will be assessable to the modern reader at all levels. This fascinating book weaves the past and present in a narrative that is sometimes harrowing, always vivid, and even, at times, amusing. Russell Fraser shows the reader each city as he himself saw it. He shuttles easily between today and yesterday, between today's Central Committee and Ivan the Great, between Turkish Istanbul and the golden Constantinople of Justinian, between today's Roman politics and the splendid Caesars. Great historical events, intellectual concerns, and artistic riches define the three Romes. Fraser goes beyond the faades, images, and myths to lay bare the three great psychologies still vying for the mind of man. The Three Romes is an utterly original book--a celebration of the past and an urbane guide to the present. Russell Fraser is Austin Warren Professor Emeritus of English Literature and Language, University of Michigan. Among his books are Moderns Worth Keeping and Shakespeare: A Life in Art, both available from Transaction, and Singing Masters, 1500 to the Present, and A Mingled Yarn: The Life of R. P.

A drop of patience,"One of the great jazz novels of any era, A Drop of Patience tells the story of a blind horn player's journey through the themes of race, blindness, and music. At the age of five, Ludlow Washington is given up by his parents to a brutal white-run state institution for blind African American children, where everyone is taught music--the only trade by which they are expected to make a living. Ludlow is a prodigy on the horn and at fifteen is ""purchased"" out of the Home by a bandleader in the fictive Southern town of New Marsails. By eighteen, he is married with a baby daughter, but as his reputation spreads, he seeks to grow musically, leaving his budding family for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in New York City. Navigating the worlds of music and race and women, Ludlow's career follows an arc towards collapse, a nervous breakdown, recovery, a long-delayed public recognition, only for him to finally abandon the spotlight and return to his roots and find solace in the black church. A Drop of Patience is a brilliant portrayal of a jazz musician. It stands apart as an exemplary parable of African American history, of racial politics, and of musical creative genius.",['William Melvin Kelley'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w5QFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=w5QFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+drop+of+patience&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Anchor,2020-06-30,http://books.google.com/books?id=w5QFEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+drop+of+patience&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],
The Chameleon Poet: A Life of George Barker,"The poet George Barker was convinced that his biography could never be written. 'I've stirred the facts around too much,' he told Robert Fraser. 'It simply can't be done.' Eliot wrote of his 'genius'. Yeats thought him the most interesting poet of his generation. Dylan Thomas envied his power over women. War trapped him in Japan. In America he conducted one of the most celebrated love affairs of the century. He fathered fifteen children in several countries, three during one battle-torn summer. By the 1950s he was the toast of Soho. Barker was Catholic and bohemian, frank and elusive, tender and boisterous. In Eliot's phrase, he was 'a most peculiar fellow.' Robert Fraser's biography offers both a portrait of a talented, tormented and irresistibly entertaining man, and a broad cultural landscape. Around the central figure cluster painters like Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, Johnny Minton and the 'Roberts' Colquhoun and MacBryde; writers such as Dylan Thomas, Walter de la Mare and Elizabeth Smart, whose By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept hymns their liaison; the lugubrious humorist Jeffrey Bernard.

Schoolteacher Thomas Abbey, unsure son of a film star, doesn't know who he is or what he wants--in life, in love, or in his relationship with the strange and intense Saxony Gardner. What he knows is that in his whole life nothing has touched him so deeply as the novels of Marshall France, a reclusive author of fabulous children's tales who died at forty-four. Now Thomas and Saxony have come to France's hometown, the dreamy Midwestern town of Galen, Missouri, to write France's biography. Warned in advance that France's family may oppose them, they're surprised to find France's daughter warmly welcoming instead.

Attila: The Scourge Of God,"A tremendous story . . . the incursion into the empire of the strangest and most frightening of the barbarian invaders - and he tells it with great verve and vigour. His prose has a pace, he has a keen eye for the significant detail, and manages the big scenes confidently' - Allan Massie, The Scotsman Early fifth century AD. The Western Roman Empire has been overrun by German tribes. Too weak to expel them, the Imperial government has been forced to grant federate status to the invaders. Aetius, the last of the great Roman generals, becomes the virtual ruler of the West over the heads of a weak and vicious emperor and his ambitious mother. In a series of brilliant campaigns, he takes on the German tribes and forces them to settle peacefully. Meanwhile, his old friend Attila, leader of the Huns, launches a devastating attack on the Eastern Empire, before turning on the West. He is confronted by Aetius, now his bitter enemy. In the epic battle that ensues, the stakes for Attila and Aetius could not be higher as the fates of empires of both Romans and Huns hang in the balance. This arresting novel deals with the rivalry between two great men whose friendship turns to enmity. Attila becomes corrupted by power, while Aetius is ennobled by it. Ross Laidlaw's masterful portrayal of these two figures is based on his extensive knowledge of the period and is written in a narrative style that vividly evokes the brutality, decadence and desperation of this fascinating time in European history.",['Ross Laidlaw'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vNO8BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=vNO8BQAAQBAJ&dq=Attila:+The+Scourge+Of+God&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Birlinn,2011-08-12,http://books.google.com/books?id=vNO8BQAAQBAJ&dq=Attila:+The+Scourge+Of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

And old Sir Simon had given his offspring not only a house--he had endowed the house with a comfortable little slice of land, either cut from the large patrimonial loaf, or else, as was more probable, collected together and separately baked for this younger branch of the family. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection.

"Ancient Skins, Parchment and Leathers (Studies in archaeological science)","INTRODUCTION TO THE TEXT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT is a shortened 358 pages of Andrews 644 pages FROM SPOKEN WORDS TO SACRED TEXTS without losing the value of content. The foremost thing the reader is going to learn is that the Greek New Testament that our modern translations are based on is a mirror-like reflection of the original and can be fully trusted. The reader will learn how the New Testament authors made and published their books, the secretaries in antiquity and their materials like Tertius who helped Paul pen the epistle to the Romans, and the book writing process of the New Testament authors and early copyists. The reader will also discover the reading culture of early Christianity and their view of the integrity of the Greek New Testament. The reader will also learn how textual scholars known as paleography determine the age of the manuscripts. The reader will learn all about the different sources that go into our restoring the Greek New Testament to its original form. Then, Andrews will cover the ancient version, the era of the printed text, and the arrival of the critical text. After that, the reader will be given a lengthy chapter on examples of how the textual scholar determines the correct reading by his looking at the internal and external evidence. Finally, and most importantly, the reader will find out the truth about the supposed 400,000 textual errors within the Greek New Testament manuscripts. The last chapter will deal with the collation and classification of manuscripts. To “collate” a manuscript is to read it and compare its text with a printed text.",['Edward D.

Samuel Coleman Dalton was the youngest, and at the age of thirteen he had dreams of an honest life. But one day an older brother was gunned down in cold blood, and Sam vowed to track down the coward who'd pulled the trigger. The trail of vengeance led straight into Indian Territory, and young Sam grew up fast, gaining a reputation and a name: the Choctaw Kid. When at last he rejoined his other brothers, the legendary Dalton Gang was born, cutting a violent trail in search of riches and renown that led to a last-stand showdown in the Daltons' hometown, where the outlaw band—surrounded, outnumbered, outgunned—faced death by hanging...or death from flying lead.

The new criticism,"This work is the first history and evaluation of contemporary American critical theory within its European philosophical contexts. In the first part, Frank Lentricchia analyzes the impact on our critical thought of Frye, Stevens, Kermode, Sartre, Poulet, Heidegger, Sussure, Barthes, Lévi-Strauss, Derrida, and Foucault, among other, less central figures. In a second part, Lentricchia turns to four exemplary theorists on the American scene—Murray Krieger, E. D. Hirsch, Jr., Paul de Man, and Harold Bloom—and an analysis of their careers within the lineage established in part one. Lentricchia's critical intention is in evidence in his sustained attack on the more or less hidden formalist premises inherited from the New Critical fathers. Even in the name of historical consciousness, he contends, contemporary theorists have often cut literature off from social and temporal processes. By so doing he believes that they have deprived literature of its relevant values and turned the teaching of both literature and theory into a rarefied activity. All along the way, with the help of such diverse thinkers as Saussure, Barthes, Foucault, Derrida, and Bloom, Lentricchia indicates a strategy by which future critical theorists may resist the mandarin attitudes of their fathers.",['Frank Lentricchia'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fRN-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fRN-DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=The+new+criticism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Chicago Press,2018-12-14,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fRN-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

"Country House Life: Family and Servants 1815-1914 (Family, Sexuality and Social Relations in Past Times)","This is an account of the lives of the families and the servants of the British country house from the end of the Napoleonic wars to the onset of the Great War. It is a pioneering history based on contemporary records, diaries, private and public autobiographies, and on the childhood recollections of living descendants. Never before have the intimacies of life above and below stairs been depicted with such clarity and vividness. Country house family and servants were the two elites of British society and this was the period of their greatest prosperity. They were closely reliant on each other. 'Our servants and we are all members of a large family, who cannot get on independently of each other,' Lady Jenne wrote in 1892. The omnipresence of the servants affected every aspect of the family's behavior and the family shared the lives of the servants: the country house was a community. The power base of the nation's political establishment, it was also home - a tangible symbol of lineage, permanence and stability, embodying in its fabric, decoration and ritual the accumulations and memories of successive generations. The book is illustrated with rare contemporary photographs, is fully referenced, has a wide ranging bibliography of primary and secondary sources, and is comprehensively indexed. Its evocation of a style of life and ways of living that have now largely vanished will be of equal interest to scholar, student and general reader.",['Jessica Gerard'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L12BQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=L12BQgAACAAJ&dq=Country+House+Life:+Family+and+Servants+1815-1914+(Family,+Sexuality+and+Social+Relations+in+Past+Times)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Wiley-Blackwell,1994-10-20,"http://books.google.com/books?id=L12BQgAACAAJ&dq=Country+House+Life:+Family+and+Servants+1815-1914+(Family,+Sexuality+and+Social+Relations+in+Past+Times)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],

A sensualist who composed erotic and playful love poetry in his youth, he was raised a Catholic but later became one of the most admired Protestant preachers of his time. The Selected Poems reflects this wide diversity, and includes his youthful Songs and Sonnets, epigrams, elegies, letters, satires, and the profoundly moving Divine Poems composed towards the end of his life. From joyful poems such as 'The Flea', which transforms the image of a louse into something marvellous, to the intimate and intense Holy Sonnets, Donne breathed new vigour into poetry by drawing lucid and often startling metaphors from the world in which he lived.

Grails is based on Groovy, which is a very popular and growing dynamic scripting language for Java developers and was inspired by Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk. Beginning Groovy, Grails and Griffon is the first introductory book on the Groovy language and its primary web framework, Grails. Griffon is also covered. While Grails is the Web framework for building Groovy Web applications, Griffon is the deskop framework for building desktop Groovy applications. Could Groovy be the new Java? It's light, fast and free (open source). This book gets you started with Groovy, Grails and Griffon, and culminates in the example and possible application of some real–world projects.

How can we ensure responsible, compassionate, even uplifting care for our aging parents at home? Mindfulness is key, Ann Cason writes.

Drawing on decades of experience in caring for the elderly, Cason helps us understand how old age feels and how we can help. Then, through exercises, care studies, and numerous examples and suggestions, Circles of Care shows how to: • Work out a plan of care • Assemble and foster a caregiving team • Create an uplifting daily routine—and vary it creatively • Plan nutrition, medical needs, finances, and outings • Improve the elder’s personal care and physical environment • Ease conflicts between elders and their caregivers or families • Avoid caregiver burnout • Work with mood swings, confusion, and memory loss",['Ann Cason'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=subDCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=subDCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT151&dq=Twelve+Weeks+in+Spring:+The+Inspiring+Story+of+Margaret+and+Her+Team&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Shambhala Publications,2001-04-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=subDCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Family & Relationships'],

Remembering Tim Horton (Peter Goddard Books),"For 18 years, Tim Horton captained a stellar Toronto Maple Leaf defensive corps that featured fellow greats Allan Stanley, Bobby Baun, and Carl Brewer. Horton, a constant threat to Bobby Hull and other offensive powerhouses of his day, led the Maple Leafs to four Stanley Cups in the 1960s, including the franchise's last Cup win in 1967. The powerful defenceman shared All-Star honours with Bobby Orr and Pierre Pilote, establishing him as one of the best defencemen ever. But Tim Horton was more than just a rock-steady rearguard. He dominated on defence. He could step into battle and stop a fight by wrapping his arms around an opposing fighter in the famed ""Horton Bear Hug."" And he was a devoted husband and father, a charitable man lost to the world far too soon. Craig MacInnis has drawn on an all-star roster of talented writers for this remarkable book, including Hockey Hall of Fame columnist Frank Orr, award-winning popculture essayist Mitch Potter, and Buffalo Sabres fan and perennial Leaf hater Doug Herod. From musings on the Leafs' great Cup runs of the '60s to an offbeat piece on Horton's vintage brush cut, Remembering Tim Horton is a quirky, and at times poignant, look back at one of the greatest rearguards ever to lace up skates.

The Water Between Us is a poetic examination of cultural fragmentation, and the exile's struggle to reconcile the disparate and often conflicting influences of the homeland and the adopted country. The book also centers on other kinds of physical and emotional distances: those between mothers and daughters, those created by being of mixed racial descent, and those between colonizers and the colonized. Despite these distances, or perhaps because of them, the poems affirm the need for a multilayered and cohesive sense of self. McCallum's language is precise and graceful. Drawing from Anancy tales, Greek myth, and biblical stories, the poems deftly alternate between American English and Jamaican patois, and between images both familiar and surreal.",['Shara McCallum'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BSN-BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=BSN-BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Water+Between+Us+(Pitt+Poetry+Series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Pittsburgh Press,2014-10-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BSN-BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Poetry'],

Are We One?: Jewish Identity in the United States and Israel,"The role of religion in a democratic society Best Book award given by the Israel Political Science Association Since the 1980s, relationships between secular and religious Israelis have gone from bad to worse. What was formerly a politics of accommodation, one whose main objective was the avoidance of strife through ""arrangements"" and compromises, has become a winner-take-all, zero-sum game. The conflict is not over who gets what. Rather, it is a conflict over the very character of the polity, a struggle to define Israel's collective character. In Israel and the Politics of Jewish Identity Asher Cohen and Bernard Susser show how this transformation has been caused by structural changes in Israel's public sphere. Surveying many different levels of public life, they explore the change of Israel's politics from a dominant-party system to a balanced two-camp system. They trace the rise of the Haredi parties and the growing consonance of religiosity with right-wing politics. Other topics include the new Basic Laws on Freedom, Dignity, and Occupation; the effects of massive immigration of secular Jews from the former Soviet Union; the greater emphasis on liberal ""good government""; and the rise of an aggressive investigative press and electronic media.","['Asher Cohen', 'Bernard Susser', 'Professor of Religion and Political Science Bernard Susser']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fSQQBdRFmwIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fSQQBdRFmwIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Are+We+One%3F:+Jewish+Identity+in+the+United+States+and+Israel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,JHU Press,2000-06-16,http://books.google.com/books?id=fSQQBdRFmwIC&dq=Are+We+One%3F:+Jewish+Identity+in+the+United+States+and+Israel&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

Way Past Cool,"Way Past Cool was the first -- perhaps the only -- novel of urban American black life in the early 1990's: the era of collapsed structures, lost dreams, dashed hopes, agonizing violence, and a level of rage that for white America is simply unfathomable. But, have things gotten any better?Way Past Cool is the story of 13-year-old boys who live alone in abandoned buildings, of 16-year-old single mothers, and of lives that make kids old by the time they graduate from junior high... if they live that long.This novel stars Gordon, who at the age of 13, leads his gang through the deadly streets of West Oakland, California. He carries a gun, has seen more people die than a Vietnam platoon leader, and can out-swear a dozen sailors. Gordon is backed by Lyon, a fragile-looking soft-spoken boy whose forays into mysticism have given him a spirituality that belies that fact that he'll blow your head off if he has to. Gordon's gang, known as The Friends, live in a state of tense coexistence with The Crew. The tenuous peace of their neighborhood is broken by Deek, a drug dealer whose bodyguard, Ty, is trying to protect his own little brother from the street life. Deek is trying to sell guns to each gang in hope of escalating their turf rivalry into real war... for his benefit. On the sidelines sit the police. The ones who aren't actually on the take are happy to let the kids kill each other off.Throughout this story of despair, violence, and hopelessness, runs a thread of human feeling and power that prevails even over the horrific reality of the characters' lives. The connection between the members of the gang is one of mutual survival, and of kids trying to meet each other's emotional needs without ""proper parental guidance"" or decent societal role-models. These young boys are violent, vulgar, and perceived by most of mainstream society as a lost cause, yet there is something uniquely human about them... all children are born knowing how to love, but must be taught how to hate. In a way that many ""kinder and gentler"" people will never understand, they love each other, and in each other they find hope.",['Jess Mowry'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=URn_MAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=URn_MAAACAAJ&dq=Way+Past+Cool&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2016-11-09,http://books.google.com/books?id=URn_MAAACAAJ&dq=Way+Past+Cool&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1.0

"The Nick of Time: Politics, Evolution, and the Untimely","In this pathbreaking philosophical work, Elizabeth Grosz points the way toward a theory of becoming to replace the prevailing ontologies of being in social, political, and biological discourse. Arguing that theories of temporality have significant and underappreciated relevance to the social dimensions of science and the political dimensions of struggle, Grosz engages key theoretical concerns related to the reality of time. She explores the effect of time on the organization of matter and on the emergence and development of biological life. Considering how the relentless forward movement of time might be conceived in political and social terms, she begins to formulate a model of time that incorporates the future and its capacity to supersede and transform the past and present. Grosz develops her argument by juxtaposing the work of three major figures in Western thought: Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Henri Bergson. She reveals that in theorizing time as an active, positive phenomenon with its own characteristics and specific effects, each of these thinkers had a profound effect on contemporary understandings of the body in relation to time. She shows how their allied concepts of life, evolution, and becoming are manifest in the work of Gilles Deleuze and Luce Irigaray. Throughout The Nick of Time, Grosz emphasizes the political and cultural imperative to fundamentally rethink time: the more clearly we understand our temporal location as beings straddling the past and the future without the security of a stable and abiding present, the more transformation becomes conceivable.",['Elizabeth Grosz'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=feR5UWpCA5cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=feR5UWpCA5cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Nick+of+Time:+Politics,+Evolution,+and+the+Untimely&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Duke University Press,2004-11-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=feR5UWpCA5cC&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],

"God, Sex & Dating: God's way brings peace and joy, blessing and order","Many Christian books talk about sexual issues within broader works on marriage, but few resources comprehensively and biblically guide couples specifically on sexual intimacy. God, Sex, and Your Marriage challenges the common assumptions couples have about sexuality and presents the richer biblical narrative of sex as a metaphor of God’s covenant love. Dr. Juli Slattery applies that biblical framework to the practical challenges in sexual intimacy. Godly sexuality extends far beyond sexual purity and calls us to sexual integrity. God invites every couple to view their sexual relationship, including their greatest struggles, as an avenue to learn about the nature of His covenant love. It’s God desire to make us more like Himself and sex within marriage is often a powerful training ground for godly character. That desire gives purpose and context to addressing pornography, healing from past wounds, sexual incompatibility, pursuing pleasure together, and forgiveness.",['Juli Slattery'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xxdTEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=xxdTEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=God,+Sex&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Moody Publishers,2022-06-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xxdTEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

He is a man who serves his country proudly and takes his oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States seriously, but is caught up in a situation that will test that sense of duty. Think all presidential elections are media events, consisting of photo opportunities, campaign promises and cheering supporters? Think again: there are forces behind the scenes, the candidates know nothing about, that will stop at nothing less than murder to achieve their own election results. Forces that no longer rely on the standard methods of election rigging, but now have the power of technology to add to their sinister bag of tools. About the Author David W. Drexler is an Information Technology Specialist, recently retired with thirty-five years experience in the designing of large, intricate computer systems.

His wizardly mentor suspects these are the effects of the perambulator, a cosmic being whose presence distorts reality.

The Roaring Silence: John Cage: A Life,"John Cage has been described as the most important composer of our time. He combined classical European training with Eastern spirituality to produce an American amalgam of such vitality and originality that it continues to define what we mean by avant-garde. His influence has touched generations of artists, including Philip Glass, David Byrne, and his longtime collaborator Merce Cunningham. His work and ideas have influenced not only the world of music but also dance, painting, printmaking, video art, and poetry. The Roaring Silence documents his life in unrivaled detail, interweaving a close account of the evolution of his work with an exploration of his aesthetic and philosophical ideas, while placing these in the greater perspective of American life and letters. Paying due attention to Cage’s inventions, such as the prepared piano, and his pioneering use of indeterminate notation and chance operations in composition (utilizing the I Ching), David Revill also illuminates Cage the performer, printmaker, watercolorist, expert amateur mycologist, game show celebrity, political anarchist, and social activist. Arnold Schoenberg once called Cage “not a composer, but an inventor—of genius.” This revised edition presents never-before-seen correspondence between Cage and other luminaries of his day, as well as new analysis into his legacy.

Work and Body,"Memoir meets craft masterclass in this “daring, honest, psychologically insightful” exploration of how we think and write about intimate experiences—“a must read for anybody shoving a pen across paper or staring into a screen or a past"" (Mary Karr). In this bold and exhilarating mix of memoir and master class, Melissa Febos tackles the emotional, psychological, and physical work of writing intimately while offering an utterly fresh examination of the storyteller’s life and the questions which run through it. How might we go about capturing on the page the relationships that have formed us? How do we write about our bodies, their desires and traumas? What does it mean for an author’s way of writing, or living, to be dismissed as “navel-gazing”—or else hailed as “so brave, so raw”? And to whom, in the end, do our most intimate stories belong? Drawing on her own path from aspiring writer to acclaimed author and writing professor—via addiction and recovery, sex work and academia—Melissa Febos has created a captivating guide to the writing life, and a brilliantly unusual exploration of subjectivity, privacy, and the power of divulgence. Candid and inspiring, Body Work will empower readers and writers alike, offering ideas—and occasional notes of caution—to anyone who has ever hoped to see themselves in a story.",['Melissa Febos'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4zeBzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=4zeBzgEACAAJ&dq=Work+and+Body&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Catapult,2022-03-15,http://books.google.com/books?id=4zeBzgEACAAJ&dq=Work+and+Body&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],2.0

The Cass Mastern Material: The Core Of Robert Penn Warren's all The King's Men (Southern Literary Studies),"One of the most striking parts of Robert Penn Warren's novel All the King's Men is Chapter 4, in which narrator Jack Burden tells the story of his distant relative Cass Mastern. A Confederate soldier, Mastern betrays his best friend by falling in love with the man's wife and then out of guilt tries repeatedly to get killed in battle but ironically becomes a hero for his daring, before finally attaining a mortal wound. In The Cass Mastern Material, James A. Perkins fully explores how this episode supplies the crucial piece to a puzzle surrounding Warren's novel, tracing the story's evolution through several versions and genres over almost twenty years. Found here are both the earliest, short-story rendition of the Cass Mastern episode, originally published in 1944, and Warren's final dramatic version, completed in 1961 and now made available in print for the first time. The play was finally staged in 1999, and Perkins appends related letters, production notes, and an interview that provide a context for understanding the work's importance in Warren's career. ""I have always felt that the section is central to [All the King's Men],"" Warren wrote, concerning the Cass Mastern material. In a revolutionary reading of the novel, Perkins argues that the section provides the key to unlocking the mystery of Jack Burden's paternity. This unique volume affords a view of Warren's restless creative process and throws new light on the story that formed the crux of his greatest novel -- a story he apparently never felt he had exhausted.",['James A.

"The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, Volume 1: Language","Ernst Cassirer occupies a unique space in Twentieth-century philosophy. A great liberal humanist, his multi-faceted work spans the history of philosophy, the philosophy of science, intellectual history, aesthetics, epistemology, the study of language and myth, and more. The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms is Cassirer's most important work. It was first published in German in 1923, the third and final volume appearing in 1929. In it Cassirer presents a radical new philosophical worldview - at once rich, creative and controversial - of human beings as fundamentally ""symbolic animals,"" placing signs and systems of expression between themselves and the world. This major new translation, the first for over fifty years, brings Cassirer's magnum opus to a new generation of students and scholars. Volume 1: Language is a fascinating examination of arguably the most fundamental of these systems of expression: human language. Cassirer traces the problem of language and expression far back in the history of philosophy, considering the work of the early Greek rationalists. He then examines the later empiricist tradition, up to the romantic tradition in the nineteenth century tackling fundamental questions about representation, signification and expression as well as language and conceptual thought in mathematics and science.

Cutting through the noise (and very mixed advice) online, while both dispelling rumors and remaining positive, Courtney Maum's Before and After the Book Deal is a one–of–a–kind resource that can help you get your book published. Before and After the Book Deal: A Writer's Guide to Finishing, Publishing, Promoting, and Surviving Your First Book has over 150 contributors from all walks of the industry, including international bestselling authors Anthony Doerr, Roxane Gay, Garth Greenwell, Lisa Ko, R.

Their wisdom will help aspiring authors find a foothold in the publishing world and navigate the challenges of life before and after publication with sanity and grace. Are MFA programs worth the time and money? How do people actually sit down and finish a novel? Did you get a good advance? What do you do when you feel envious of other writers?

Covering questions ranging from the logistical to the existential (and everything in between), Before and After the Book Deal is the definitive guide for anyone who has ever wanted to know what it’s really like to be an author.",['Courtney Maum'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aKacDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=aKacDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=The+Published+Author%27s+Guide+to+Promotion&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Catapult,2020-01-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aKacDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],2.0

Julie was a young and energetic twenty- four- year- old woman with her whole life ahead of her. Planning the wedding of her dreams to her college sweetheart and finishing her Master's degree in Social Work, life couldn't get any better! Although life was headed in the right direction for Julie, her health had other plans. Julie began noticing vague symptoms which became bothersome to her studies. She hesitated to voice these problems due to the fact 'she looked fine on the outside'. For a year, Julie dealt with ongoing fatigue and pain which was attributed to the stress of planning a wedding and working toward a master's degree. Eventually, the symptoms worsened and Julie needed to seek medical attention. What would the doctors tell her? How would she react? Ten years later, Julie is talking about how she coped through the challenges and got through the difficult days in dealing with lupus. ""Life is a rollercoaster"", Julie says. ""It has its ups and downs, but you just have to take one day at a time. I feel God has blessed me with Lupus, so that I can reach out to others. My life could be a whole lot worse, and I've seen a whole lot worse"". Julie's Story, 'My Life With Lupus' has been written for all of those who suffer from an autoimmune disease.

The Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping / Harvard Design School Project on the City 2,"SHOPPING is arguably the last remaining form of public activity. Through a battery of increasingly predatory forms, shopping has infiltrated, colonized, and even replaced, almost every aspect of urban life. Town centers, suburbs, streets, and now airports, train stations, museums, hospitals, schools, the Internet, and the military are shaped by the mechanisms and spaces of shopping. The voracity by which shopping pursues the public has, in effect, made it one of the principal-if only-modes by which we experience the city. The Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping explores the spaces, people, techniques, ideologies, and inventions by which shopping has so dramatically refashioned the city. Perhaps the beginning of the twenty-first century will be remembered as the point where the urban could no longer be understood without shopping. The PROJECT ON THE CITY, formerly known as ""The Project for What Used to be the City,"" is an ongoing research effort that examines the effects of modernization on the urban condition. Each year the Project on the City investigates a specific urban region or a general urban condition undergoing virulent change. It tries to capture and decipher ongoing mutations in order to develop a new conceptual framework and vocabulary for phenomena that can no longer be described within the traditional categories of architecture, landscape, and urban planning. The first project, Great Leap Forward, focuses on the new forms and speeds of urbanization in the Pearl River Delta, China. The second project investigates the impact of shopping on the city. The third project explores the urban condition of Lagos, Nigeria. The fourth project treats the invention and expansion of the ""systematic"" Roman city as an early version of modernization and a prototype for the current process of globalization.","['Chuihua Judy Chung', 'Jeffrey Inaba', 'Rem Koolhaas', 'Sze Tsung Leong']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S6zUQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=S6zUQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Harvard+Design+School+Guide+to+Shopping+/+Harvard+Design+School+Project+on+the+City+2&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Taschen America Llc,2001-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=S6zUQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Harvard+Design+School+Guide+to+Shopping+/+Harvard+Design+School+Project+on+the+City+2&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Architecture'],
Seeing Earth from Space,"As our interest in space continues to grow, the cultural effects of space exploration become important. In Seeing Earth, Ronald Weber focuses on the literary response to this new frontier, examining an area of contemporary expression that has remained until now virtually untouched. The author surveys what has been written about space exploration and calls attention to its dominant use as a means of deflecting attention back to earth and earthly concerns. As Norman Cousins states, the ""most significant achievement of that lunar voyage (Apollo 11) was not that man set foot on the Moon, but that he set eyes on Earth."" This timely study includes the responses of writers, scientists, historians, theologians, philosophers, and those who have experienced space first hand - the astronauts. Here we find, of course, Tom Wolfe and The Right Stuff, Carl Sagan, James Michener, and Norman Mailer. But Weber also discusses Oriana Fallaci, Ben Bova, Ken Kesey, Saul Bellow, Ray Bradbury, and others as they offer a literary embodiment of this newest and perhaps ultimate phase of American journeying, the newest New World, the darkest frontier. Weber finds that in the first quarter-century of the space age our writers have been more attentive to the familiar attractions of earth than the mysteries of outer space, paradoxically in their accounts of space returning us to earth. Seeing Earth is offered, however, as a preliminary report. The era of the space shuttle, with the promise of routine journeys in space, may well alter the response of writers. We may come to see ourselves at home in space. But so far the deepest sympathies of our writers have been directed to the origin of space rockets more than their exotic destinations. Weber shows us that our literary accounts of space journeys have given us new instruction about earth and earthly life.",['Ronald Weber'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s-BZAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=s-BZAAAAMAAJ&q=Seeing+Earth+from+Space&dq=Seeing+Earth+from+Space&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1985,http://books.google.com/books?id=s-BZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Seeing+Earth+from+Space&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

"Color for Science, Art and Technology, Volume 1 (AZimuth)","The aim of this book is to assemble a series of chapters, written by experts in their fields, covering the basics of color - and then some more. In this way, readers are supplied with almost anything they want to know about color outside their own area of expertise. Thus, the color measurement expert, as well as the general reader, can find here information on the perception, causes, and uses of color. For the artist there are details on the causes, measurement, perception, and reproduction of color. Within each chapter, authors were requested to indicate directions of future efforts, where applicable. One might reasonably expect that all would have been learned about color in the more than three hundred years since Newton established the fundamentals of color science. This is not true because: • the measurement of color still has unresolved complexities (Chapter 2) • many of the fine details of color vision remain unknown (Chapter 3) • every few decades a new movement in art discovers original ways to use new pigments, and dyes continue to be discovered (Chapter 5) • the philosophical approach to color has not yet crystallized (Chapter 7) • new pigments and dyes continue to be discovered (Chapters 10 and 11) • the study of the biological and therapeutic effects of color is still in its infancy (Chapter 2).

Conversations With William H. Gass (Literary Conversations),"Biography -- Literary Criticism--> Conversations with William H. Gass captures the imagination and philosophical acumen of one of America's most important aestheticians, critical theorists, fiction writers, and essayists. From his first major novel, Omensetter's Luck (1966), to his numerous collections of essays and philosophical inquiries, to his controversial novel The Tunnel (1995), Gass (b. 1924) has proved himself a meticulous craftsman. Throughout these interviews, he reveals an aesthetic that combines ideas from sources as disparate as Ludwig Wittgenstein, Rainer Maria Rilke, Gertrude Stein, and Plato. The interviews make clear the unity behind Gass's views is by his own design. Conversations retrace his undergraduate years at Kenyon College and his subsequent philosophical investigation of metaphor at Cornell University. Gass has never strayed from his belief that metaphor is central and fundamental to thought and to aesthetics. In these interviews he reiterates time and again his belief that the ultimate understanding of the relationship of language to the world pivots on one's understanding of metaphor. In interviews, in profiles, and in his own essays, Gass does not hide from questions about his art and personal motivations, no matter how frequently they are asked, nor does he toy with his interviewers. Revealing how he never shies from an intellectual joust, this collection includes a rousing, contentious debate with John Gardner, fellow literary pundit and fiction writer. The distinction of Gass's prose is matched by the clarity and brilliance of the mind behind it. These talks allow an unobstructed view. Anyone interested in Gass's writing will delight in hearing the brutally honest voice of the mind that produced it. Theodore G. Ammon is chair of the philosophy department at Millsaps College in Jackson, Miss. His work has appeared in such publications as Romance Notes, Arachne, College Mathematics, and the Journal of Aesthetic Education.",['William H.

Ark File,"No other object mentioned in the annals of ancient history and mythology has so stirred the imagination of amateur archaeologists as the ship known to us as Noah's ark. In The Ark File, the author has traced the almost unbelievable tale of research and frustration that has accompanied the modern search for it. Is the story of Noah's ark and the Flood a mere myth, or is it possibly the agonizing account of a survivor of the greatest tragedy ever to befall mankind?

Creatures Of Habitat: The Changing Nature of Wildlife and Wild Places in Utah and the Intermountain West,"From flying squirrels on high wooded plateaus to hanging gardens in redrock canyons, the Intermountain West is home to some of the world's rarest and most fascinating animals and plants. Creatures of Habitat details many unique but little-known talents of this region's strange and wonderful wild inhabitants and descibes their connections with native environments. For example, readers will learn about the pronghorn antelope's supercharged cardiovascular system, a brine shrimp-powered shorebird that each year flies nonstop from the Great Salt Lake to Central Argentina, and a rare mustard plant recently discovered on Mount Ogden. Emphasizing how increasing loss and degradation of habitat hinders native species' survival, Mark Gerard Hengesbaugh discusses what is happening to wildlife and wild places and what is being done about it. Well illustrated, this book has habitat maps, pen-and-ink illustrations, and fifty photos of wildlife and wild places selected by photo editor Dan Miller. Also included are guides to wildlife viewing and lists of Utah species, including those considered sensitive, threatened, or endangered.",['Mark Hengesbaugh'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N4oaAyNLJ64C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=N4oaAyNLJ64C&q=Creatures+Of+Habitat:+The+Changing+Nature+of+Wildlife+and+Wild+Places+in+Utah+and+the+Intermountain+West&dq=Creatures+Of+Habitat:+The+Changing+Nature+of+Wildlife+and+Wild+Places+in+Utah+and+the+Intermountain+West&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2001-05,http://books.google.com/books?id=N4oaAyNLJ64C&dq=Creatures+Of+Habitat:+The+Changing+Nature+of+Wildlife+and+Wild+Places+in+Utah+and+the+Intermountain+West&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Nature'],

After Progress: American Social Reform and European Socialism in the Twentieth Century,"The twentieth century witnessed a profound shift in both socialism and social reform. In the early 1900s, social reform seemed to offer a veritable religion of redemption, but by the century's end, while socialism remained a vibrant force in European society, a culture of extreme individualism and consumption all but squeezed the welfare state out of existence. Documenting this historic change, After Progress: European Socialism and American Social Reform in the 20th Century is the first truly comprehensive look at the course of social reform and Western politics after Communism, brilliantly explained by a major social thinker of our time. Norman Birnbaum traces in fascinating detail the forces that have shifted social concern over the course of a century, from the devastation of two world wars, to the post-war golden age of economic growth and democracy, to the ever-increasing dominance of the market. He makes sense of the historical trends that have created a climate in which politicians proclaim the arrival of a new historical epoch but rarely offer solutions to social problems that get beyond cost-benefit analyses. Birnbaum goes one step further and proposes a strategy for bringing the market back into balance with the social needs of the people. He advocates a reconsideration of the notion of work, urges that market forces be brought under political control, and stresses the need for education that teaches the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Both a sweeping historical survey and a sharp-edged commentary on current political posturing, After Progress examines the state of social reform past, present and future.",['Norman Birnbaum'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eM_QCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=eM_QCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=After+Progress:+American+Social+Reform+and+European+Socialism+in+the+Twentieth+Century&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,2001-02-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eM_QCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],

Students planning to attend college take the SAT II: Math Level IC Subject Test for one of two reasons: (1) Because it is an admission requirement of the college or university to which they are applying; OR (2) To demonstrate proficiency in Mathematics. The SAT II: Math Level IC exam is designed for students who have taken more than three years of college preparatory mathematics (two years of algebra and one year of geometry). Who Administers The Test? The SAT II: Math Level IC Subject Test is developed by the College Board and administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS). The test development process involves the assistance of educators throughout the country, and is designed and implemented to ensure that the content and difficulty level of the test are appropriate. When Should the SAT II: Math Level IC be Taken? If you are applying to a college that requires Subject Test scores as part of the admissions process, you should take the SAT II: Math Level IC Subject Test by November or January of your senior year. If your scores are being used only for placement purposes, you may be able to take the test in the spring. For more information, be sure to contact the colleges to which you are applying. When and Where is the Test Given? The SAT II: Math Level IC Subject Test is administered five times a year at many locations throughout the country; mostly high schools. The test is given in November, December, January, May, and June. To receive information on upcoming administrations of the exam, consult the publication Taking the SAT II: Subject Tests, which may be obtained from your guidance counselor or by contacting: College Board SAT Program P.O. Box 6200 Princeton, NJ 08541-6200 Phone: (609) 771-7600 Website: http://www.collegeboard.com Is There a Registration Fee? You must pay a registration fee to take the SAT II: Math Level IC. Consult the publication Taking the SAT II: Subject Tests for information on the fee structure. Financial assistance may be granted in certain situations. To find out if you qualify and to register for assistance, contact your academic advisor. What Kind of Calculator Can I Use? Your calculator should be, at the minimum, a scientific calculator. It can be programmable or non-programmable. Bear in mind, however, that for perhaps 60 percent of the test items, the calculator will afford you no advantage and, moreover, may actually work against you. No pocket organizers, hand-held minicomputers, paper tape, or noisy calculators may be used. In addition, no calculator requiring an external power source will be allowed. Finally, no sharing of calculators will be permitted - you must bring your own. Make sure you are thoroughly familiar with the operation of your calculator before the test. Your performance on the test could suffer if you spend too much time searching for the correct function on your calculator. HOW TO USE THIS BOOK What Do I Study First? Remember that the SAT II: Math Level IC Subject Test is designed to test knowledge that has been acquired throughout your education. Therefore, the best way to prepare for the exam is to refresh yourself by thoroughly studying our review material and taking the sample tests provided in this book.

Currier & Ives Christmas: Dreams and Secrets/Snow Storm/Image of Love/Circle of Blessings (Inspirational Christmas Romance Collection),"In the 1800s--long before the days of photojournalism and cable news--vibrant, contemporary depictions of news events, portraits of prominent political and social figures, and scenic views of the American wilderness were circulated throughout the growing nation. From the beginning of the exciting century that saw a small nation expand into a mighty world power, the famous lithographic firm of Nathaniel Currier and James Merritt Ives produced over 7,000 prints, capturing scenes of American life in vivid detail. Currier & Ives prints were each colored individually, by hand, and collectors have prized their skilled craftsmanship and keen sense of composition for generations. This timeless collection, complete with more than three hundred illustrations in full color and a masterful text by historian Walton Rawls, captures a beloved piece of Americana.

Quaternary Extinctions presents the latest and most comprehensive examination of these questions.

ÑScientific American ""Represents a quantum leap in our knowledge of Pleistocene and Holocene palaeobiology. . . . Many volumes on our bookshelves are destined to gather dust rather than attention. But not this one."" ÑNature ""Two strong impressions prevail when first looking into this epic compendium. One is the judicious balance of views that range over the whole continuum between monocausal, cultural, or environmental explanations.

The Net Warriors,"Nic Granger didn't plan to save the world. He just wanted to play The Three Kings of Orr online and defeat the Deceiver. The Deceiver had other ideas. As the land of Orr's nastiest villain, he had escaped into the real world some weeks before when the man who invented inter reality chips actually made one work. When Nic finds himself in Orr, an amazing journey begins through time, space, the Internet and the world of his own street. With the help his best friend Frog, younger sister Emily, the knight Riddith and Princess Rhea, The Net Warriors are born. They are joined by a host of other characters including Bruce, a dragon with appallingly smelly breath and Prefix, a mace with the character of a playful puppy. As for the hackers, who is black hat and who is white? Follow their adventures to the End of Time as they are captured by the Hellriders, battle with the headless horsemen, and try to find the Deceiver before he finds them. Can they put the worlds of reality and inter-reality back to how they should be? A review by Suzanne Coleburn, Reader To Reader Reviews If you are a lover of virtual reality games you are going to love THE NET WARRIORS. This enticing story begins when a Japanese man who designed Dec chips for digital entertainment and home control centers with the latest computer technology in the beginning of the 21st Century changed things in the world one day when he decided to change things with his game ""The Three Kings of Orr."" The game was complex, net based and linked to a web ring, rather than DVD or disc based and what happens next is wild and wooly. Katana assumed the part of the Wise King and while in the game he activated his mortal enemy, the Deceiver who was a shrewd and unsavory character who could change into human and animals at will. Before he knows it Katana is dissolved into the game and disappears. The special IR chip that Kantana designed was installed in a DEC set and sent to the Granger family in a small country town in England where a young 14 year old boy named Nic who has a copy of ""The Three Kings of Orr"" receives a special message of help on his monitor screen. Nic assumes the persona of the Wise King of Orr and types the words in the message and finds himself blending into the screen and into the game. What a blast. This fast paced story rockets into the fantasy world of Orr and into the reality of life in England, America and Australia as the good guys and the baddies come together trying to save the world from the Deceiver. Lindsey Hall does a bang up job of keeping his readers glued to the screen finding out what is going to happen next. A jolly good story. Don't miss it!

Knowledge Discovery for Business Information Systems (The Kluwer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science Volume 600),"As other complex systems in social and natural sciences as well as in engineering, the Internet is hard to understand from a technical point of view. Packet switched networks defy analytical modeling. The Internet is an outstanding and challenging case because of its fast development, unparalleled heterogeneity and the inherent lack of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in its core conception. This monograph deals with applications of computational intelligence methods, with an emphasis on fuzzy techniques, to a number of current issues in measurement, analysis and control of traffic in the Internet. First, the core building blocks of Internet Science and other related networking aspects are introduced. Then, data mining and control problems are addressed. In the first class two issues are considered: predictive modeling of traffic load as well as summarization of traffic flow measurements. The second class, control, includes active queue management schemes for Internet routers as well as window based end-to-end rate and congestion control. The practical hardware implementation of some of the fuzzy inference systems proposed here is also addressed. While some theoretical developments are described, we favor extensive evaluation of models using real-world data by simulation and experiments.","['Federico Montesino Pouzols', 'Diego R.

"Tom Valenti's Soups, Stews, and One-Pot Meals: 125 Home Recipes from the Chef-Owner of New York City's Ouest and Cesca","This is the way we love to eat -- slowly braised, cut-with-a-spoon-tender meat resting in aromatic juices just waiting for the perfect piece of bread to come along and sop it up; a steaming bowl of chowder filled with chunks of fish and potatoes in rich broth laced with the smoky-sweet-salty flavor of bacon; a casserole that's spent some serious time in the oven as layer upon layer of creamy, soft cheese, pasta, herbs, and meat meld into a delectable whole. And as luck would have it, this is the way celebrated New York City chef Tom Valenti loves to cook. Considered Manhattan's grandmaster of comfort food, Valenti has made this beloved cooking his trademark. In fact, on any given night, you'll find him in his wildly successful Upper West Side restaurants Ouest and 'Cesca feeding the world's A-list -- Bill Clinton, Steven Spielberg, Charlie Rose, Jerry Seinfeld, Judy Collins, Joan Didion. Because, of course, this is the food they love to eat, too. In Tom Valenti's Soups, Stews, and One-Pot Meals, Valenti and coauthor Andrew Friedman dish up the flavor we've come to expect from a New York chef, without any of the fuss. This is food that gets better a day or two after it's made, food to make on the weekend and savor throughout a busy week, food that is perfect for dinner parties and family celebrations. Here are 125 realistic recipes for the home cook -- most made in one pot -- and all based on the fact that the right ingredients, left alone to cook in a single vessel with virtually no intervention from the cook, steadily build glorious flavor and leave far fewer pots to clean. The book includes ""Variations"" and ""Tomorrow's Table,"" tips on ways to embellish a dish by adding vegetables or meats or provide economy by stretching it into another satisfying meal by simply adding another ingredient. Valenti and Friedman embrace what they term ""cooking in the real world,"" encouraging home cooks to use canned stocks and beans whenever appropriate. They discuss key ingredients; offer a section on condiments, garnishes, and accompaniments; provide a list of mail-order sources; and recommend cookware (though you won't need a lot).","['Tom Valenti', 'Andrew Friedman']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0al0Et4g9F8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=0al0Et4g9F8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Tom+Valenti%27s+Soups,+Stews,+and+One-Pot+Meals:+125+Home+Recipes+from+the+Chef-Owner+of+New+York+City%27s+Ouest+and+Cesca&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Simon and Schuster,2012-09-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0al0Et4g9F8C&source=gbs_api,['Cooking'],

The American Mind,"New York Times Bestseller • Finalist for the 2018 National Book Critics Circle Award in Nonfiction • A New York Times Notable Book • Bloomberg Best Book of 2018 “Their distinctive contribution to the higher-education debate is to meet safetyism on its own, psychological turf . . . Lukianoff and Haidt tell us that safetyism undermines the freedom of inquiry and speech that are indispensable to universities.” —Jonathan Marks, Commentary “The remedies the book outlines should be considered on college campuses, among parents of current and future students, and by anyone longing for a more sane society.” —Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Something has been going wrong on many college campuses in the last few years. Speakers are shouted down. Students and professors say they are walking on eggshells and are afraid to speak honestly. Rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide are rising—on campus as well as nationally. How did this happen? First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt show how the new problems on campus have their origins in three terrible ideas that have become increasingly woven into American childhood and education: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker; always trust your feelings; and life is a battle between good people and evil people. These three Great Untruths contradict basic psychological principles about well-being and ancient wisdom from many cultures. Embracing these untruths—and the resulting culture of safetyism—interferes with young people’s social, emotional, and intellectual development. It makes it harder for them to become autonomous adults who are able to navigate the bumpy road of life. Lukianoff and Haidt investigate the many social trends that have intersected to promote the spread of these untruths. They explore changes in childhood such as the rise of fearful parenting, the decline of unsupervised, child-directed play, and the new world of social media that has engulfed teenagers in the last decade. They examine changes on campus, including the corporatization of universities and the emergence of new ideas about identity and justice. They situate the conflicts on campus within the context of America’s rapidly rising political polarization and dysfunction. This is a book for anyone who is confused by what is happening on college campuses today, or has children, or is concerned about the growing inability of Americans to live, work, and cooperate across party lines.","['Greg Lukianoff', 'Jonathan Haidt']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pbqkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=pbqkDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=The+American+Mind&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2019-08-20,http://books.google.com/books?id=pbqkDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+American+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],7.0

Master Larry Sang's 2003 the Year of the Sheep Chinese Astrology and Feng Shui Guide,"Cate Bramble has devoted her career to highlighting the differences between 'feng shui-lite' as a fashionable pursuit in contrast to the original intentions of the Chinese masters. Here she presents the authentic principles in a technical, no-nonsense pocket book specifically for architects. As clients become more demanding and the competition for projects heats up, the architect is well advised to have many strings to their bow. This practical guide includes line illustrations that present the principles of feng shui, the Chinese art or practice in which a structure or site is chosen or configured so as to harmonize with the spiritual forces that inhabit it, and their application in architecture through planning principles, services, building elements and materials, in an accessible, easy reference format. The feng shui-savvy architect can also benefit from feng shui's ability to match structures and land, and the peculiar capacity of authentic feng shui to forecast development-related concerns including cost overruns, quality issues - even worker injuries and trade disputes! The author explains feng shui from archaeological sources and evidence of practice in the east, contrasting it with what passes for feng shui in the west. She analyses the practice in terms of such concepts as western systems theory, viewshed, space syntax and the 'pattern landscape' theory of urban planning. For the first time, the Sustainable implications of feng shui design are explained with reference to the latest developments in behavioural and cognitve sciences, evolutionary biology and other western viewpoints.",['Cate Bramble'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wf8_dpGXPEsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Wf8_dpGXPEsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Master+Larry+Sang%27s+2003+the+Year+of+the+Sheep+Chinese+Astrology+and+Feng+Shui+Guide&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2007-06-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wf8_dpGXPEsC&source=gbs_api,['Architecture'],1.0

The CIA: Forgotten History,"""The CIA: a forgotten history tells the remarkable story of the CIA interventions in more thatn fifty countries, from the earliest actions in China to the present day campaign against Nicaragua. Investigative writer William Blum describes the grim role played by the Agency in overthrowing governments, preventing elections, assassinating leaders, suppressing revolutions, manipulating trade unions and manufacturing 'news' -- in detail that's never before appeared in one book. Blum also shows how the mainstream media have frequently not bothered to probe, highlight or even report many of America's aggressive actions abroad. Effectively, this has helped the US Government camoflague its operations and intentions abroad ever since World War II. Washington's deception and the media's laxity combine to leave us functionally illiterate about the history of modern US foreign policy. And that, the author believes, is good neither for democracy, nor for development and world peace.

Moses: The Servant of God,"The life of Moses is most inspiring. At a certain point in that life he was called by God to be ""My servant."" Indeed, living for 120 years, Moses' servanthood was divided into three periods of 40 years each. During the first 40 years Moses tried to serve God according to his own way—which was the way he had learned from the world. So, during the second 40 years of his life, which was spent entirely out in the desert wilderness of Midian, Moses had to unlearn all he had learned previously, and also he had to learn God. Finally, throughout the entire concluding 40-year period of his long life, Moses was used by God as His faithful servant. Let us see that, like Moses, in order to be able to serve God, we must first unlearn all which we have learned from the world. Then, and only then, can anyone serve God. A true servant of God must be selfless and be absolutely obedient to God. He may suffer incessantly from others, but he will be approved by God. And this is all that matters. May we all learn to serve God as Moses did!",['Stephen Kaung'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K7VcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=K7VcDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Moses:+The+Servant+of+God&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Christian Fellowship Publishers,2018-05-23,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K7VcDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],
Dancing on the Edge,"The National Book Award-winning novel of a young girl’s coming of age, from the author of Send Me Down a Miracle. Twelve-year-old Miracle McCloy never liked the story of her remarkable birth, but her grandmother Gigi has always loved telling it. An expert in occult magic, Gigi insists that when Miracle was saved from her dead mother’s womb, it was an omen of greatness to come. But how can Miracle become a prodigy like her father when sometimes she feels like she doesn’t even exist? When her father suddenly vanishes without a trace, Miracle’s life starts feeling less miraculous by the day. The only time she feels whole is when she’s dancing—an activity her grandmother strictly forbids.

What Are We Hoping For? New Testament Images,"In this follow-up to his popular book What Are We Hoping For? New Testament Images, Daniel J. Harrington extends his reflections on hope in the Scriptures. He draws us into the striking images of the psalms?the mountain, the sun, refuge, the kingdom, sheltering wings, the olive tree, and the shepherd?to lead us to the discovery that hope is the predominant image of the book of Psalms. Even in their darkest laments, the psalmists remind us that God hears us and will never abandon us. In these brief essays, Harrington opens up the language of forty psalms, explores their literary and historical context, and then ties the psalm to our reading as Christians whose ultimate hope is in Jesus Christ. As we read and reflect on the psalms with Harrington?s guidance, we call to mind the ways we experience God and our hopes, both daily and for all time. Drawn into the world of the psalmist and discovering how our experiences often mirror theirs, we too will express our hope in God?s love and mercy and in the coming of God?s kingdom. ?Daniel Harrington once again puts his unparalleled knowledge of the Bible at the disposal of his many readers in order to help them to pray to God who is our hope. This time he helps us to make the psalms our own prayer by showing us how they expressed the hope of the Israelites who wrote them and prayed them. One can only hope that Dan will continue to use his immense scholarship for ?the help of souls,? a favorite phrase of Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits. I am proud to count Dan as one of my brothers in the Lord.? William A. Barry, SJ Campion Renewal Center Weston, Massachusetts?That a serious biblical scholar can continue to gift us with accessible, devotional and historical-critical studies of important theological ideas is, itself, cause for hope. Few do so as well as Fr. Daniel Harrington. In his christological reading of the Psalms Harrington shows us that hope has a rough side. One of the best features of these fine readings of the Psalms is that Harrington doesn't explain away the raw emotions of those ancient writers who looked to God for hope. What a relief!?

The Al Jazeera Phenomenon: Critical Perspectives on New Arab Media,"Few phenomena in the Arab world are more controversial than Al Jazeera - the satellite television news channel that, despite its brief history, has made its impact known throughout the world and changed the face of a formerly parochial Arab media.This timely collection of articles, many by Arabic-speaking scholars, gives us more information and analysis of the network - and how it has affected the public and even the foreign policies of Western governments - than any other of the very few books published in English up to now.The book provides rare insights into Al Jazeera's politics, its agenda, its programs, its coverage of regional crises, and its treatment of the West. The authors attempt to gauge the station's impact on ordinary Arab viewers, understand its effect on an increasingly visible Arab public sphere, and map out the role it plays in regional Arab politics. The image of Al Jazeera that emerges from this book is much more complex than its depiction in American media. It reveals the powerful role that the network plays in shaping ideas and reconstructing Arab identities during a crucial juncture in Middle Eastern history and politics.",['Mohamed Zayani'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jAKaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=jAKaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Al+Jazeera+Phenomenon:+Critical+Perspectives+on+New+Arab+Media&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2019-05-23,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jAKaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],

Along with “Energetic Invocations” is Part Three–People.

Buy the book, absorb the authors’ energized discussions, invest in yourself and do the work, and be a part of your own self-empowerment journey! From the Authors: If you have any interest in things other than people’s stories, complaints and drama, and feel that there is something else out there, you’re right, there is. And that’s where we are. Social media, television, movies, other self-help books are unfulfilling. They just perpetuate an empty feeling. If you are interested in what everyone else is doing, keep supporting them. Yet, if you are interested in accessing something else within yourself and all around you, our books help to open the door to magick, science, creativity, and psychic ability. We work with energy. What does that mean? Everyone wants to talk to us or be in our conversations. So, we wrote about what we know and have experienced. If you want to be in our conversations, listen to our podcasts. Otherwise, read our books, that’s where the energy is. Find our books on our Amazon Author pages.

Work and Islam,"Master's Thesis from the year 2016 in the subject Business economics - Banking, Stock Exchanges, Insurance, Accounting, , course: Islamic banking, language: English, abstract: This study was primarily designed to review the impact of Islamic Work Ethics on employees’ job performance; this is because of the persistent immoral concerns in the society and corporations like dishonesty, fraud, sexual harassment, etc. The elements of Islamic work ethics for this study cover honesty, rewards, commitment and satisfaction only. The study specifically focuses on UUM administrative staff. In order to achieve the research objectives, the study employ a quantitative research method, mainly survey where questionnaires were distributed to the respondents. The research population is UUM administrative staff in Sintok main campus. The study is significant to the body of knowledge, policy makers, practitioners and academicians. Since most of literatures on perceived benefits of Islamic work ethics are theoretical, this study will add on the stock of knowledge on Islamic ethics through empirical contributions. Therefore, it will contribute to knowledge on this field. Policy makers and Islamic corporations can design their code of ethics to incorporate Islamic values and this will have great positive impact on their performance as well as economic growth. Future researchers can explore more on other variables as well as expand the size of the study in order to contribute more to knowledge. Ethics and morality are core values of all divine religions. All divine religions that are revealed by Allah to His messengers with divine books promote ethics and morality. According to Mayne ethics runs deeper than the internal compass and describes a social system or societal structure of moral codes that govern virtuous action. From a secular perspective, ethics change from group to group and society to society. But from the Christian perspective, ethics should be concrete and governed by God. Christian ethics does not change from society to society, as secular moral codes may do, Christians are a single group adhering to the ethical code of the Bible, rather than multiple sects adhering to differing laws and customs.",['Abshir Khalif Farah'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ro1ODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ro1ODwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Work+and+Islam&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,GRIN Verlag,2018-03-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ro1ODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],

In New York City, one manÕs sleep is filled with tormenting visions of the evils that mankind visits upon itself, compelling him to act.

No one sees him at his work until he chooses to reveal himselfÑno one, that is, except the woman who is destined to be the light to his darkness. Written by comics legends Matt Wagner and Steven T.

Give the Winds a Mighty Voice: The Story of Charles E. Fuller,"For almost thirty years, twenty million people tuned in weekly to Charles E. Fuller and the ""Old Fashioned Revival Hour."" Sunday after Sunday, they listened over radio as the crowd, gathered in Long Beach Auditorium, wafted the strains of ""Jesus Saves"" around the world. In this firsthand account Daniel P. Fuller chronicles the life and work of his father, a man whose name is almost synonymous with gospel broadcasting and who founded the theological seminary that bears his name. The strong evangelistic urge that dominated Charles E. Fuller's ministry permeates every page of Give the Winds a Mighty Voice. The early broadcasts, the struggle for financial support to stay on the air, and the sermons full of fiery concern for the lost made Charles E. Fuller an unparalleled phenomenon in the history of religious radio. More than that, he was a personal friend to those who gathered to hear the old gospel preached by a man who believed the whole Bible. Daniel Fuller probes into the deep intentions that motivated his father to strive by faith, and often against seemingly impossible odds, to keep the broadcast going. Quoting from the thousands of letters that arrived daily, he recounts the response that millions made as they listened around the world. The biography of Charles E. Fuller is the story of a religious movement. As you read Give the Winds a Mighty Voice, you will relive both the disappointments and the victories of which so many people were a part. Christians in every land are part of the rich heritage bestowed by Charles E. Fuller through the medium of gospel broadcasting. Your memory of the tradition will be enriched and cherished as you read this moving account of his life and thought.",['Daniel P.

"Suspensions of Perception: Attention, Spectacle, and Modern Culture (October Books)","Suspensions of Perception decisively relocates the problem of aesthetic contemplation within a broader collective encounter with the unstable nature of perception—in psychology, philosophy, neurology, early cinema, and photography. Suspensions of Perception is a major historical study of human attention and its volatile role in modern Western culture. It argues that the ways in which we intently look at or listen to anything result from crucial changes in the nature of perception that can be traced back to the second half of the nineteenth century. Focusing on the period from about 1880 to 1905, Jonathan Crary examines the connections between the modernization of subjectivity and the dramatic expansion and industrialization of visual/auditory culture. At the core of his project is the paradoxical nature of modern attention, which was both a fundamental condition of individual freedom, creativity, and experience and a central element in the efficient functioning of economic and disciplinary institutions as well as the emerging spaces of mass consumption and spectacle. Crary approaches these issues through multiple analyses of single works by three key modernist painters—Manet, Seurat, and Cezanne—who each engaged in a singular confrontation with the disruptions, vacancies, and rifts within a perceptual field. Each in his own way discovered that sustained attentiveness, rather than fixing or securing the world, led to perceptual disintegration and loss of presence, and each used this discovery as the basis for a reinvention of representational practices. Suspensions of Perception decisively relocates the problem of aesthetic contemplation within a broader collective encounter with the unstable nature of perception—in psychology, philosophy, neurology, early cinema, and photography. In doing so, it provides a historical framework for understanding the current social crisis of attention amid the accelerating metamorphoses of our contemporary technological culture.",['Jonathan Crary'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U0SUP5b1jUMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=U0SUP5b1jUMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Suspensions+of+Perception:+Attention,+Spectacle,+and+Modern+Culture+(October+Books)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",MIT Press,2001-08-24,"http://books.google.com/books?id=U0SUP5b1jUMC&dq=Suspensions+of+Perception:+Attention,+Spectacle,+and+Modern+Culture+(October+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Design'],2.0

Acquainted with the Night: A Parent's Quest to Understand Depression and Bipolar Disorder in His Children,"In the tradition of Kay Redfield Jamison’s An Unquiet Mind, Acquainted with the Night is a powerful memoir of one man’s struggle to deal with the adolescent depression and bipolar disorder of his son and his daughter. Seven years ago Paul Raeburn’s son, Alex, eleven, was admitted to a psychiatric hospital after leaving his fifth-grade classroom in an inexplicable rage. He was hospitalized three times over the next three years until he was finally diagnosed by a psychiatrist as someone exhibiting a clear-cut case of bipolar disorder. This ended a painful period of misdiagnosis and inappropriate drug therapy. Then Raeburn’s younger daughter, Alicia, twelve, was diagnosed as suffering from depression after episodes of self-mutilation and suicidal thoughts. She too was repeatedly admitted to psychiatric hospitals. All during this terrible, painful time, Raeburn’s marriage was disintegrating, and he had to ask what he and his wife might have done, unwittingly, to contribute to their children’s mental illness. And so, literally to save his children’s lives, he used all the resources available to him as a science reporter and writer to educate himself on their diseases and the various drugs and therapies available to help them return from a land of inner torment. In Paul Raeburn’s skilled hands, this memoir of a family stricken with the pain of depression and mania becomes a cathartic story that any reader can share, even as parents unlucky enough to be in a similar position will find it of immeasurable practical value in their own struggles with the child psychiatry establishment.",['Paul Raeburn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_EUcwlTuDHgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_EUcwlTuDHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Acquainted+with+the+Night:+A+Parent%27s+Quest+to+Understand+Depression+and+Bipolar+Disorder+in+His+Children&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crown,2007-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_EUcwlTuDHgC&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],1.0

As the idea of childhood innocence took hold, it became racialized: popular culture constructed white children as innocent and vulnerable while excluding black youth from these qualities. Actors, writers, and visual artists then began pairing white children with African American adults and children, thus transferring the quality of innocence to a variety of racial-political projects--a dynamic that Robin Bernstein calls ""racial innocence."" This phenomenon informed racial formation from the mid nineteenth century through the early twentieth, while enabling sharply divergent political agendas to appear, paradoxically, to be innocuous, natural, normal, and therefore justified. Racial Innocence takes up a rich archive including books, toys, theatrical props, and domestic knickknacks which Bernstein analyzes as ""scriptive things"" that invite or prompt historically-located practices while allowing for resistance and social improvisation. Integrating performance studies with literary and visual analysis, Bernstein offers singular readings of theatrical productions, literary works, material culture including Topsy pincushions and Raggedy Ann dolls, and visual texts ranging from fine portraiture to advertisements for lard substitute. Throughout, Bernstein shows how ""innocence"" gradually became the exclusive province of white children--until the Civil Rights Movement succeeded not only in legally desegregating public spaces, but in culturally desegregating the concept of childhood itself.",['Robin Bernstein'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kbIUCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=kbIUCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA286&dq=The+live+dolls+in+Wonderland.+An+omnibus+for+children.+Containing+The+Live+Dolls+House+Party,+The+Live+Dolls+busy+days%3B+The+Live+Dolls+in+wonderland.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",NYU Press,2011-12,"http://books.google.com/books?id=kbIUCgAAQBAJ&dq=The+live+dolls+in+Wonderland.+An+omnibus+for+children.+Containing+The+Live+Dolls+House+Party,+The+Live+Dolls+busy+days%3B+The+Live+Dolls+in+wonderland.&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Social Science'],

MAYHEM,"The first novel in a sexy, emotional new adult series for fans of Jamie McGuire and Jay Crownover. When college freshman Rowan Michaels meets gorgeous, up-and-coming rock star Adam Everest, she knows a player like him is the last thing she needs after her ex-boyfriend shattered her heart. But she can't stop thinking about the kiss they shared on his tour bus. On the first day of school, Rowan is stunned when Adam saunters into her French class. He's soon failing miserably, and, on a whim, she offers to tutor him. But Adam doesn't recognize her as a makeup-free, glasses-clad college student—a far cry from the beautiful, mysterious ""Peach"" he met at his concert. During a wild weekend on tour with the band, Rowan can't help falling for the sweet guy buried beneath Adam's rocker persona. Yet she knows she could never compete with the girls constantly throwing themselves at his feet. She'd just end up hurt … again. Peach is all Adam thinks about, though, and when Rowan realizes this, she has a decision to make: stay just friends to protect her fragile heart … or reveal the truth about the night they met and admit she's fallen completely, hopelessly in love with him.",['Jamie Shaw'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d2sOBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=d2sOBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=MAYHEM&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2015-01-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d2sOBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2.0
"Merging Lines : American Railroads, 1900-1970","Why did American railroads decline from the glory days of the early twentieth century? Why did so many railroad mergers in the 1950s and 1960s, intended as a panacea for the ills of an outdated system, go sour and, in fact, make a bad situation worse? Saunders addresses these and many other issues in this authoritative history of U.S. railroads and their corporate mergers. Beginning with a wide-ranging analysis of the role of railroads in the economic and social fabric of American life, Saunders traces the causes and results of the twentieth century's ""merger mania."" Mergers, he explains, were expected to save money, to improve service to customers, and to help railroads compete against other modes of transportation, such as the growing airline and trucking industries. Saunders then gives colorful, richly detailed accounts of the mergers and shows the reasons--including corporate greed and the inept blundering of government regulatory agencies--the outcomes fell far short of expectations. Merging Lines explores the impact of shifting political control of railroads as no history has done before. The fates of both workers and railroad companies were dictated by the rise and fall of business and governmental leaders, including Bill Brosnan, Robert R. Young, Alfred Perlman, President John F. Kennedy, and President Lyndon B. Johnson. As power struggles erupted, the original goals of the mergers were thwarted by consumer frustration, violent labor strikes, and organizational collapse. Saunders explores these and other crucial developments in this extensive work, carefully designed for railroad historians and enthusiasts at any level. Encyclopedic in its scope, Merging Lines includes sixty-eight maps, a list of court cases involving railroad mergers, and a wealth of information on American railroads from coast to coast. An extensively revised, updated, and supplemented edition of Saunders's earlier classic, The Railroad Mergers and the Coming of Conrail (1978), it is essential reading for all who are interested in railroad and transportation history.",['Richard Saunders'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cJdrQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=cJdrQgAACAAJ&dq=Merging+Lines+:+American+Railroads,+1900-1970&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","DeKalb, Ill. : Northern Illinois University Press",2001,"http://books.google.com/books?id=cJdrQgAACAAJ&dq=Merging+Lines+:+American+Railroads,+1900-1970&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Transportation'],

Ideology and Superstructure in Historical Materialism,"Ideology and Superstructure was written at a time - in the inter-war years - when Marxism existed almost entirely in its Stalinst form. Franz Jakubowski set out to reintroduce the centrality of the Hegelian dialectic into Marx's method and to elaborate the concept of praxis.In the same period, only Lukacs and Korsch attempted to deal systemically with these problems, and it is they who are generally recognised as the main inspiration behind what is called Western Marxism, yet Franz Jakubowski is a key figure in the development of Marxist thought. And, unlike the others, Jakubowski was also an activist, and for this reason avoids the unnecessarily dense language of his fellow theoreticians.Ideology and Superstructure is rare in that it successfully conveys complex problems in a simple and straightforward form. At a time when the literature on Marx has become excessively obscuranist, Jakubowski's work serves as a useful antidote, and is an ideal text for introducing novices to the basics of Marxist theory.",['Franz Jakubowski'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Tr4fAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Tr4fAAAAMAAJ&q=Ideology+and+Superstructure+in+Historical+Materialism&dq=Ideology+and+Superstructure+in+Historical+Materialism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Pluto Press,1990,http://books.google.com/books?id=Tr4fAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ideology+and+Superstructure+in+Historical+Materialism&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Dialectical materialism'],

"Reading Neoplatonism: Non-discursive Thinking in the Texts of Plotinus, Proclus, and Damascius","Neoplatonism is a term used to designate the form of Platonic philosophy that developed in the Roman Empire from the third to the fifth century A.D. and that based itself on the corpus of Plato's dialogues.

The Alchemist's Daughter: A Novel,"Based on some of literature’s horror and science fiction classics, this “tour de force of reclaiming the narrative, executed with impressive wit and insight” (Publishers Weekly, starred review) debut is the story of a remarkable group of women who come together to solve the mystery of a series of gruesome murders—and the bigger mystery of their own origins. Mary Jekyll, alone and penniless following her parents’ death, is curious about the secrets of her father’s mysterious past. One clue in particular hints that Edward Hyde, her father’s former friend and a murderer, may be nearby, and there is a reward for information leading to his capture…a reward that would solve all of her immediate financial woes. But her hunt leads her to Hyde’s daughter, Diana, a feral child left to be raised by nuns. With the assistance of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, Mary continues her search for the elusive Hyde, and soon befriends more women, all of whom have been created through terrifying experimentation: Beatrice Rappaccini, Catherin Moreau, and Justine Frankenstein. When their investigations lead them to the discovery of a secret society of immoral and power-crazed scientists, the horrors of their past return.

Columbia Pictures: Portrait of a Studio,"Drawing on previously untapped archival materials including letters, interviews, and more, Bernard F. Dick traces the history of Columbia Pictures, from its beginnings as the CBC Film Sales Company, through the regimes of Harry Cohn and his successors, and ending with a vivid portrait of today's corporate Hollywood. The book offers unique perspectives on the careers of Rita Hayworth and Judy Holliday, a discussion of Columbia's unique brands of screwball comedy and film noir, and analyses of such classics as The Awful Truth, Born Yesterday, and From Here to Eternity. Following the author's highly readable studio chronicle are fourteen original essays by leading film scholars that follow Columbia's emergence from Poverty Row status to world class, and the stars, films, genres, writers, producers, and directors responsible for its transformation. A new essay on Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood rounds out the collection and brings this seminal studio history into the 21st century.

Frame Reflection: Toward The Resolution Of Intractrable Policy Controversies,"Why are controversies about such issues as abortion, welfare, persistent poverty, and environmental destruction so intractable? As anyone who has ever engaged in or tried to settle an argument on highly charged issues knows, facts rarely persuade in such situations. This innovative approach to intractable policy controversies shows how ""reframing"" the issues can succeed where simply appealing to facts often fails. In Frame Reflection, two of his country's leading organizational theorists and policy analysts show how disputes that in abstract debate or negotiation seem insoluble can sometimes be resolved pragmatically by those who actually have to design and implement the specific programs. The authors illustrate their theory through a detailed examination of three specific programs: the evolution of early retirement programs in Germany; a statewide project for the homeless in Massachusetts; and the development of Project Athena, a large-scale experiment in the use of computers in undergraduate education at MIT. Policy stalemates are inevitable. Yet we know that people sometimes do change their minds, even in situations that at first appeared hopeless.

"Whales, Dolphins & Porpoises (Nature Company Guides)","The eighty-nine cetacean species that swim our seas and rivers are as diverse as they are intelligent and elusive, from the hundred-foot-long, two-hundred-ton blue whale to the lesser-known tucuxi, ginkgo-toothed beaked whale, and diminutive, critically endangered vaquita. The huge distances these highly migratory creatures cover and the depths they dive mean we catch only the merest glimpses of their lives as they break the surface of the water. But thanks to the marriage of science and technology, we are now beginning to understand their anatomy, complex social structures, extraordinary communication abilities, and behavioral patterns. In this beautifully illustrated guide, renowned marine mammalogist Annalisa Berta draws on the contributions of a pod of fellow whale biologists to present the most comprehensive, authoritative overview ever published of these remarkable aquatic mammals. Opening with an accessible rundown of cetacean biology—including the most recent science on feeding, mating, and communication—Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises then presents species-specific natural history on a range of topics, from anatomy and diet to distribution and conservation status.

The Price of Love,"A young woman's desperate pursuit of love reveals secrets from more than one source... Anne Baker writes a compelling saga in The Price of Love, detailing the trials of life and love. Perfect for fans of Nadine Dorries and Katie Flynn. Kate McGlory longs to be loved. Her seven younger brothers are cherished by their doting mother Lena, but Kate tends to be forgotten. Then Kate catches the eye of Jack Courtney and at last she too is adored. But their courtship is not straightforward. Jack comes from a family of wealthy ship-owners in Merseyside, who may not approve of the match; Lena is terrified that history will repeat itself if her daughter falls in love with a man above her station; and, worst of all, Jack has not been entirely honest with Kate from the start... What readers are saying about The Price of Love: 'Beautifully written, the characters come to life on the page as their story unfolds.

An agricultural testament,"Why is there a cow on the front cover of this book? This is a book about agriculture, and farm animals have become unfashionable in some quarters. Cows, it turns out, are responsible for global warming, climate change, and so, no doubt, rising sea levels and chemtrails. But any real farmer, from any time in history, knows that this is not true. Animals have been around forever. Animals are a vital part of an insanely complex living system. Anyone who knows the basics of regenerative agriculture understands this. Albert Howard spent years studying and using the methods of traditional Asian agriculture, and shows in this book that the fertility and health of the soil depend on humus, in the production of which animal materials play an vital role. A healthy soil needs animal inputs. Animals in agriculture are central; they're right in there with fungi. This message is not welcomed by those who would feed the modern world a diet of plant-based, lab-grown food substitutes that have lists of ingredients as long as your arm, and are going to save the planet using gene-spliced soybeans and 3D printed pizzas. So, the cow and her calf are on the cover to redress the balance, and also to feature as one of the stars of this book (along with sugar cane, waste pits, and public servants). She was the photogenic one. Albert Howard's text has been thoroughly re-edited in this new version of his book. The habit, common at the time, of using long paragraphs is not preferred by modern readers, so the text has been extensively 'reparagraphed'. Grammar has been tweaked, and styles have been adopted. Headings have been added, infinitives unsplit. The changes made have been to make things more comfortable for modern eyes and tastes. The sense and intention of the author has not been altered at all, of course. We hope that Albert Howard would approve of this reworking of his book. His ideas are more important than ever. Wendell Berry wrote in The Last Whole Earth Catalog ""Howard's discoveries and methods, and their implications, are given in detail in An Agricultural Testament. They are of enormous usefulness to gardeners and farmers, and to anyone who may be interested in the history and the problems of land use. But aside from its practical worth, Howard's book is valuable for his ability to place his facts and insights within the perspective of history. This book is a critique of civilisations, judging them not by their artefacts and victories, but by their response to the sacred duty of handing over to the next generation, unimpaired, the heritage of a fertile soil.""",['Albert Howard'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ME9pzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ME9pzgEACAAJ&dq=An+agricultural+testament&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Distant Mirror,2021-04,http://books.google.com/books?id=ME9pzgEACAAJ&dq=An+agricultural+testament&hl=&source=gbs_api,,

"The Gang That Wouldn't Write Straight: Wolfe, Thompson, Didion, and the New Journalism Revolution",". . . In Cold Blood, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, The Armies of the Night . . . Starting in 1965 and spanning a ten-year period, a group of writers including Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson, Joan Didion, John Sack, and Michael Herr emerged and joined a few of their pioneering elders, including Truman Capote and Norman Mailer, to remake American letters. The perfect chroniclers of an age of frenzied cultural change, they were blessed with the insight that traditional tools of reporting would prove inadequate to tell the story of a nation manically hopscotching from hope to doom and back again—from war to rock, assassination to drugs, hippies to Yippies, Kennedy to the dark lord Nixon. Traditional just-the-facts reporting simply couldn’t provide a neat and symmetrical order to this chaos. Marc Weingarten has interviewed many of the major players to provide a startling behind-the-scenes account of the rise and fall of the most revolutionary literary outpouring of the postwar era, set against the backdrop of some of the most turbulent—and significant—years in contemporary American life. These are the stories behind those stories, from Tom Wolfe’s white-suited adventures in the counterculture to Hunter S. Thompson’s drug-addled invention of gonzo to Michael Herr’s redefinition of war reporting in the hell of Vietnam. Weingarten also tells the deeper backstory, recounting the rich and surprising history of the editors and the magazines who made the movement possible, notably the three greatest editors of the era—Harold Hayes at Esquire, Clay Felker at New York, and Jann Wenner at Rolling Stone. And finally Weingarten takes us through the demise of the New Journalists, a tragedy of hubris, miscalculation, and corporate menacing. This is the story of perhaps the last great good time in American journalism, a time when writers didn’t just cover stories but immersed themselves in them, and when journalism didn’t just report America but reshaped it. “Within a seven-year period, a group of writers emerged, seemingly out of nowhere—Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson, Joan Didion, John Sack, Michael Herr—to impose some order on all of this American mayhem, each in his or her own distinctive manner (a few old hands, like Truman Capote and Norman Mailer, chipped in, as well). They came to tell us stories about ourselves in ways that we couldn’t, stories about the way life was being lived in the sixties and seventies and what it all meant to us. The stakes were high; deep fissures were rending the social fabric, the world was out of order. So they became our master explainers, our town criers, even our moral conscience—the New Journalists.” —from the Introduction",['Marc Weingarten'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pmsGOSBQdOoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=pmsGOSBQdOoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Gang+That+Wouldn%27t+Write+Straight:+Wolfe,+Thompson,+Didion,+and+the+New+Journalism+Revolution&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Crown,2010-03-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pmsGOSBQdOoC&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],

Omdurman,"General Kitchener amassed his Anglo-Egyptian troops in Cairo and set off into the desert with a motley arm which, as time went on, included the Grenadier Guards, the Rifle Brigade and kilted Highlanders; The Camel Corps with 5,000 camels, infantry packed into trucks on the newly constructed railway line; and a flotilla of gunboats overloaded with cavalry and supplies. The going was often tough and the opposition from the Government in London seemed sometimes as obdurate as that provided by the Dervishes. But, in 1898 the army at last came in sight of Omdurman capital of the Mahdi's successor, the Khalifa. The story of the battle which followed, a clash between spears, swords and frenzied courage on the one hand and the grim application of rifle and gunboat fire on the other, is breathtaking, bizarre and beautifully handled by the author.",['Philip Ziegler'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WTYBAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=WTYBAAAAMAAJ&q=Omdurman&dq=Omdurman&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,HarperCollins,1973,http://books.google.com/books?id=WTYBAAAAMAAJ&dq=Omdurman&hl=&source=gbs_api,"['Omdurman, Battle of, Omdurman, Sudan, 1898']",

Psalms for Healing [With Ribbons (3)],"The Psalms as Christian Lament, a companion volume to The Psalms as Christian Worship, uniquely blends verse-by-verse commentary with a history of Psalms interpretation in the church from the time of the apostles to the present. Bruce Waltke, James Houston, and Erika Moore examine ten lament psalms, including six of the seven traditional penitential psalms, covering Psalms 5, 6, 7, 32, 38, 39, 44, 102, 130, and 143. The authors -- experts in the subject area -- skillfully establish the meaning of the Hebrew text through careful exegesis and trace the church's historical interpretation and use of these psalms, highlighting their deep spiritual significance to Christians through the ages. Though C. S. Lewis called the ""imprecatory"" psalms ""contemptible,"" Waltke, Houston, and Moore show that they too are profitable for sound doctrine and so for spiritual health, demonstrating that lament is an important aspect of the Christian life.","['Bruce K.

"Victoria Victorious (Queens of England, Vol 3)",,,,,,,,,
"Portable Chaucer, The","In the fourteenth century Geoffrey Chaucer, who served three kings as a customs official and special envoy, virtually invented English poetry. He did so by wedding the language of common speech to metrical verse, creating a medium that could accommodate tales of courtly romance, bawdy fabliaux, astute psychological portraiture, dramatic monologues, moral allegories, and its author’s astonishing learning in fields from philosophy to medicine and astrology. Chaucer’s accomplishment is unequalled by any poet before Shakespeare and—in The Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Cressida—ranks with that of the great English novelists. Both The Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Cressida are presented complete in this anthology, in fresh modern translations by Theodore Morrison that convey both the gravity and gaiety of the Middle English originals. The Portable Chaucer also contains selections from The Book of Duchess, The House of Fame, The Bird's Parliament, and The Legend of Good Women, together with short poems. Morrison's introduction is vital for its insights into Chaucer as man and artist, and as a product of the Middle Ages whose shrewdness, humor, and compassion have a wonderfully contemporary ring.",['Geoffrey Chaucer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0hy3q85lptAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=0hy3q85lptAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Portable+Chaucer,+The&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Penguin,1977-05-26,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0hy3q85lptAC&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],
Alternative Conceptions of Civil Society.,"The idea of civil society has long been central to the Western liberal-democratic tradition, where it has been seen as a crucial site for the development and pursuit of basic liberal values such as individual freedom, social pluralism, and democratic citizenship. This book considers how a host of other ethical traditions define civil society. Unlike most studies of the subject, which focus on a particular region or tradition, it considers a range of ethical traditions rarely addressed in one volume: libertarianism, critical theory, feminism, liberal egalitarianism, natural law, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Confucianism. It considers the extent to which these traditions agree or disagree on how to define civil society's limits and how to evaluate its benefits and harms. A variety of distinguished advocates and interpreters of these traditions present in-depth explorations of how these various traditions think of ethical pluralism within societies, asking how a society should respond to diversity among its members. Together they produce a work rich with original insights on a wide range of subjects about which little has been written to date. An excellent starting point for a comparative ethics of civil society, this book concludes that while the concept of civil society originated in the liberal tradition, it is quickly becoming an important focus for a truly cross-cultural dialogue. In addition to the editors, the contributors are Michael Banner, Hasan Hanafi, Loren E. Lomasky, Richard Madsen, Michael A. Mosher, Michael Pakaluk, Anne Philips, Adam B.

Kiril and Methodius: Founders of Slavonic Writing : A Collection of Sources and Critical Studies (East European Monographs),"In addition to five critical essays from modern times, It contains a variety of late 9th through 10th century material in translation, a good deal of it side by side with the Old Church Slavonic. This is a great book to have for anyone interested in knowing what the students Cyril and Methodius believed and taught. It is very eclectic, covering not only what we would consider religious thought, but also natural philosophy and science, politics of language, history and even a bit of psychology. It also has the Saint's Lives of Cyril, Methodius, and Clement of Ohrid, which are fairly straightforward but, as they were written by contemporaries, give a good historical background to the more ""academic"" primary sources. occasional typos and relatively poor printing quality (especially for the Cyrillic selections) is a bit of a disappointment, but its still an invaluable resource for anyone interested in slavic religious and literary culture.",['Ivan Dujčev (red.)'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WSAmAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=WSAmAQAAMAAJ&q=Kiril+and+Methodius:+Founders+of+Slavonic+Writing+:+A+Collection+of+Sources+and+Critical+Studies+(East+European+Monographs)&dq=Kiril+and+Methodius:+Founders+of+Slavonic+Writing+:+A+Collection+of+Sources+and+Critical+Studies+(East+European+Monographs)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Columbia University Press,1985,http://books.google.com/books?id=WSAmAQAAMAAJ&dq=Kiril+and+Methodius:+Founders+of+Slavonic+Writing+:+A+Collection+of+Sources+and+Critical+Studies+(East+European+Monographs)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Church Slavic literature'],
"Leitrim & Longford, 1798","This illustrated, well indexed book, was created exclusively to help you find your family in Counties Cavan and Leitrim in Ireland. Focusing specifically on families within these neighbouring counties, the book includes an introduction to research and sources in each county. The most numerous families from birth records are given, as well as rather rare Cavan and Leitrim families found in heraldic records. Included you will find a full page map of both counties from the Atlas of Ireland, along with a listing of modern parishes and old townlands, along with the address and location of records for more research. This work includes copies of actual records (some worn, torn and faded), it also includes rough sketches of family coats of arms and notes from centuries past - seldom found elsewhere. The resources provided here will help research any family in the county, including old Irish families, and settler families from England, Scotland, Wales and the continent. This book is a hands on guide for finding your family in Cavan and Leitrim - some family history is included - but it is not a gigantic collection of family histories. For that see 'The Book of Irish Families Great and Small'.","[""Michael C.

Uniquely You,"For young professionals and entrepreneurs, there is no shortage of gurus, processes, and quick-fix formulas to chase in the quest to grow their business, lead their team, and find personal fulfillment. In fact, there are so many out there that it's exhausting. Wouldn't it be better to realize that the leadership lessons we need to learn are not out there somewhere, but in here, in our own lives? That instead of becoming a knock-off of someone else, we can be uniquely ourselves? That's exactly what Ron Kitchens learned, and it's what he wants to share with today's emerging leaders. Sharing his own journey of discovering what his life was trying to teach him through both trials and triumphs, Kitchens equips readers to mine their own stories for the relationships and life lessons that have made them into the unique individuals they are today. He then shows readers how to leverage those unique experiences into their own personal leadership style that is authentic, one-of-a-kind, and effective in building businesses and leading teams.",['Ron Kitchens'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xJlkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xJlkDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Uniquely+You&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Baker Books,2019-05-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xJlkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],

Real Bravo Two Zero,"The true story of the most famous SAS operation in history. 'Bravo Two Zero' was the code-name of the famous SAS operation: a classic story of bravery in the face of overwhelming odds. BRAVO TWO ZERO by patrol commander 'Andy McNab' became an international bestseller, as did the book by 'Chris Ryan' (THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY). Both men became millionaires. Three members of the patrol were killed. One, veteran sergeant Vince Phillips, was blamed in both books for a succession of mistakes. As Michael Asher reveals, the stories in BRAVO TWO ZERO and THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY grew considerably in the telling. Their heroic tales of taking out tanks with their rocket launchers, mowing down hundreds of Iraqi soldiers, the silent stabbing of the occasional sentry, were never mentioned at their post-war debriefings...

Half-Jewish, he is unable to attend his high school due to Nazi laws, but as a mathematical genius, he has gained access to an opportunity that will assumedly spare and support him and eight other “special cases.” Though Josef is unable to forget about the war and the unknown fate of his family for the two years the Institute offers him sanity and safety, he and the others manage to discover friendship, love, and generosity within and between each other. They work side by side, under the direction of Professor Avilov (The Chief), on genetic experiments and nuclear research—quietly attempting to sabotage the war that is funding their work. Each day for two years, Josef fears that the dreamlike opportunity he has been dropped into might shatter, and that the nightmare of the genocide and war outside will infiltrate his safe haven.

The Klondike fever;: The life and death of the last great gold rush,“Absolutely first-rate.”—The New Yorker This thrilling story is at once first-rate history and first-rate entertainment. Incredible events occurred in North America after a decrepit steamboat docked at Seattle in 1897 containing two tons of pure gold. So frenzied was the clash for gold and so scant was information about conditions in the Klondike that the rush for riches became a kind of fabulous madness. The entire tale—of which Pierre Berton’s account is the definitive telling—has an epic ring (legends were lived and fortunes were won) as much because of its splendid folly as because of its color and motion. “The definitive account of an affair as wildly improbable as any in North American history.”—Saturday Review “A lively saga of the great gold rush.

"From Omaha to Okinawa;: The story of the Seabees,","William Bradford Huie, joined the U.S. Navy in 1943. He was commission as a public relations officer in the little-known Civil Engineer Corps' Construction Battalions––the Seabees. The following year he published “Can Do!”, an account of their landing with the Marines at Guadalcanal and Wake Island, Sicily and Salerno. This book is a sequel to “Can Do!” and continues the saga of the combat trained civilian plumbers, carpenters, heavy equipment operators, wharf builders, and civil engineers who served in the U.S. Navy construction battalions. The story begins with Iwo Jima when the Seabees braved concentrated enemy fire to rig floating causeways, blow up wrecked landing craft, and to build the desperately needed airstrips while under enemy fire. Huie also describes the Seabees on D-Day at Omaha Beach, where they manned fifteen hundred vehicles during the first wave of landings at Normandy. He provides the details of the creation and testing of various pier-heads, floating steel bridges, and “Rhino” ferries. He also tells colorful stories of moon-shining, brawling, and carousing along with compassionate stories of the children in the prisoner of war camps.",['William Bradford Huie'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OYD9oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=OYD9oAEACAAJ&dq=From+Omaha+to+Okinawa%3B:+The+story+of+the+Seabees,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",CreateSpace,2014-05-04,"http://books.google.com/books?id=OYD9oAEACAAJ&dq=From+Omaha+to+Okinawa%3B:+The+story+of+the+Seabees,&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],

Friends and Enemies - Peer Relations in Childhood,"In the second edition of his unique study of peer relationships in childhood, Dr Barry Schneider re-examines this fundamental aspect of childhood. Taking the work of Jacob Moreno as its starting point, the book provides an up-to-date and accessible understanding of how children develop social competence in different environments, from school to cyberspace. It is informed by a cross-cultural perspective that examines how peer relationships vary in different cultures, as well as among children who have migrated to a new culture, and provides increased coverage of how bullying is perceived and managed within peer groups. The book is informed, too, by new research techniques, both qualitative and quantitative, which mean we know far more about how children relate to each other than ever before. Childhood Friendships and Peer Relations is a fascinating and very timely overview of what we know about making friends and enemies in childhood, showing how these relationships can have lasting effects. It will be essential reading to all students of Developmental Psychology and Educational Psychology, as well as anyone training towards a career working with children and young people.",['Barry Schneider'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ehu4CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Ehu4CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Friends+and+Enemies+-+Peer+Relations+in+Childhood&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2016-03-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ehu4CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Psychology'],

Lux and Alby: Sign on and Save the Universe,"When Lux the Poet and Alby Starvation, famed inhabitants of South London's least salubrious areas, find themselves thrown together, the fabric of the universe starts to crumble. The arrival of Ruby, with her plans for total domination of the squatting group, leads them into a fantastic (and quite upsetting) adventure featuring beautiful Goddesses, unhappy, plants, sad rocks, and a full scale assault on Nirvana. While Lux figures that his sensational good looks will probably carry him through any crisis, Alby Starvation, dedicated only to protecting his precious comic collection, is very unhappy. The prospect of having an adventure, and maybe even finding a girlfriend, is almost too much to bear. Ruby, a talented woman with an aversion to shoes, is of the opinion that neither ancient Gods nor terrible flatmates should interfere with the important things in life, like taking revenge on her ex-boyfriend. Will Nirvana ever be free? Will the rocks, plants and fairies ever smile again? Will Lux the Poet manage to charm his way to another benefit cheque?

The Pre-Raphaelites & Their World,"The Pre-Raphaelite Movement began in 1848, and experienced its heyday in the 1860s and 1870s. Influenced by the then little-known Keats and Blake, as well as Wordsworth, Shelley and Coleridge, Pre-Raphaelite poetry 'etherialized sensation' (in the words of Antony Harrison), and popularized the notion ofl'art pour l'art - art for art's sake. Where Victorian realist novels explored the grit and grime of the Industrial Revolution, Pre-Raphaelite poems concentrated on more abstract themes of romantic love, artistic inspiration and sexuality.

EXILED IN PARADISE,"A brilliant look at the writers, artists, scientists, movie directors, and scholars—ranging from Bertolt Brecht to Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, Thomas Mann, and Fritz Lang—who fled Hitler's Germany and how they changed the very fabric of American culture. In a new postscript, Heilbut draws attention to the recent changes in reputation and image that have shaped the reception of the German exiles. This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press’s mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact. Drawing on a backlist dating to 1893, Voices Revived makes high-quality, peer-reviewed scholarship accessible once again using print-on-demand technology.

Talking at Trena's: Everyday Conversations at an African American Tavern,"Talking at Trena's is an ethnography conducted in a bar in an African American, middle-class neighborhood on Chicago's southside. May's work focuses on how the mostly black, working- and middle-class patrons of Trena's talk about race, work, class, women, relationships, the media, and life in general. May recognizes tavern talk as a form of social play and symbolic performace within the tavern, as well as an indication of the social problems African Americans confront on a daily basis. Following a long tradition of research on informal gathering places, May's work reveals, though close description and analysis of ethnographic data, how African Americans come to understand the racial dynamics of American society which impact their jobs, entertainment—particularly television programs—and their social interactions with peers, employers, and others. Talking at Trena's provides a window into the laughs, complaints, experiences, and strategies which Trena's regulars share for managing daily life outside the safety and comfort of the tavern.",['Reuben A.

The Courage of Our Confusions: The Last Hurrah of a Senior Citizen (With The Help of William James),"It was once said of Ben Franklin that in the final decade of his life he had reached the age ""when life slopes to an end."" So here I am in my 8th decade, sliding down that slippery slope! It has been a great ride!During my life as an author of 8 books, I have written about other people and what they believed. A Christian Century reviewer of my Contemporary American Theologies. A Critical Survey gave his assessment: ""Ferm's greatest asset is his uncanny ability to synthesize these diverse theologies into a larger conceptual whole...A landmark of clarity."" This is what I have tried my best to do!Here, however, as I slide down the slippery slope, I express my own views which never seem to settle down, but keep changing with the challenge of new experiences. My lifetime mentor has been America's greatest philosopher William James whose writings have taught me to be aware of ""the varieties of religious experience"" and ""the right to believe"" about the things that matter the most.In this book I confront such important issues as the meaning of religion, faith and doubt, the elusive inner self, God, Jesus, the bible, the church, the life to come - and I end with a challenge to senior citizens to get on with their unfinished doubts and lives. My deepest conviction is that the more I know, the less I know - that life continues to be a bewildering Mystery. I will continue investigating the central claims of religion while discarding the old myths with new realities. Let us make these claims our religious act! The greatest risk is not taking one! Let us always have the courage of our confusions!Deane William Ferm",['Deane W.

In this insider’s guide, former Onion editor Joe Randazzo delivers a funny and insightful blueprint for those looking to turn their sense of humor into a vocation, and solicits advice and stories from the likes of Judd Apatow, Jack Handey, Weird Al Yankovic, Rob Delaney, Joan Rivers, Tim & Eric, Nick Kroll, Lisa Hanawalt, and more.

American Indian Moses,"American Indian Moses: An essential and timely message for all Native Americans.A must read to understand their origin and, more importantly, their destiny.Timothy Dom Bucci, the author, was an ordained Evangelist in The Church of Jesus Christ (world headquarters in Monongahela, Pennsylvania). He was a zealous missionary and writer of pamphlets and articles. For over forty years he brought a special message to Native Americans in Oklahoma and various reservations in New York, Arizona, North Carolina and Ontario. He made many friends among the Native Americans and was a close friend of the late Chief Clinton Rickard of the Tuscarora Nation.In this book, Timothy confidently delivers his message that a Native American Indian will rise up among his own people in the near future to deliver them from spiritual bondage and social oppression. As Moses delivered his people thousands of years ago, so will this Native American. Timothy combines Biblical and Ancient American history to draw astonishing spiritual and cultural parallels between the ancient Israelites and the present-day Native American Indians including their common ancestry and destiny.From the PrefaceIn 1975 a small but mighty book was published. There were only several hundred copies printed at that time. Those close to the author of the book held on tightly to their copies since it was out of print before it could gain the audience it deserved. The book I am referring too is ""American Indian Moses."" We will backtrack for a moment to the late 1950's, would-be-author Timothy Dom Bucci is speaking to me of the great promises in God's plan for the Native Peoples of the America's. I distinctly remember him talking at great length concerning the divine origin of the Translated Ancient American Writings commonly known as the Book of Mormon. As I grew older his encouraging words and the example he set in his life as a disciple of Jesus Christ left a great impression on me. The culmination of his life dedicated to such a beautiful cause was brought forth in the initial printing of this book. But Timothy D. Bucci's calling as a messenger, to spread the news of the brilliant future of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, was brought to paper and ink in the form of ""American Indian Moses."" Almost thirty years after the first printing a newly updated version is now available to all lovers of truth who desire to understand one of God's great unalterable truths. Never in the history of the United States of America has there been a greater need for a concise composition concerning the future events, which we will be swept up into. Never has there been a greater need for the light of Truth to dispel the spiritual heavy darkness that surrounds both the Native American and the citizens of this nation. I have waited with great enthusiasm for the opportunity to share the information in this book with those who I believe will not only find merit in it, but comfort and hope as it looks to the great events of the near future for both American Indians and Israel. And if not at first then maybe through the workings of the Great Spirit its truth will be confirmed.Read this book thoughtfully and prayerfully because its topic is timely and relevant to each and every one of us and most importantly to the Native Peoples of North, Central and South America.

Crisis of the house divided;: An interpretation of the issues in the Lincoln-Douglas debates,"This definitive analysis of the Lincoln-Douglas debates is “one of the most influential works of American history and political philosophy ever published (National Review). In Crisis of the House Divided, noted conservative scholar and historian Harry V. Jaffa illuminates the political principles that guided Abraham Lincoln from his reentry into politics in 1854 through his Senate campaign against Stephen Douglas in 1858. Through critical analysis of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Jaffa demonstrates that Lincoln’s political career was grounded in his commitment to constitutionalism, the rule of law, and abolition. A landmark work of American history, it “has shaped the thought of a generation of Abraham Lincoln and Civil War scholars."" To mark the fiftieth anniversary of the original publication, Jaffa has provided a new introduction (Civil War History). ""A searching and provocative analysis of the issues confronted and the ideas expounded in the great debates…A book which displays such learning and insight that it cannot fail to excite the admiration even of scholars who disagree with its major arguments and conclusions.""—D.

Covering: The Hidden Assault on Our Civil Rights,"A lyrical memoir that identifies the pressure to conform as a hidden threat to our civil rights, drawing on the author’s life as a gay Asian American man and his career as an acclaimed legal scholar. “[Kenji] Yoshino offers his personal search for authenticity as an encouragement for everyone to think deeply about the ways in which all of us have covered our true selves. . . . We really do feel newly inspired.”—The New York Times Book Review Everyone covers. To cover is to downplay a disfavored trait so as to blend into the mainstream. Because all of us possess stigmatized attributes, we all encounter pressure to cover in our daily lives. Racial minorities are pressed to “act white” by changing their names, languages, or cultural practices. Women are told to “play like men” at work. Gays are asked not to engage in public displays of same-sex affection. The devout are instructed to minimize expressions of faith, and individuals with disabilities are urged to conceal the paraphernalia that permit them to function. Given its pervasiveness, we may experience this pressure to be a simple fact of social life. Against conventional understanding, Kenji Yoshino argues that the work of American civil rights law will not be complete until it attends to the harms of coerced conformity. Though we have come to some consensus against penalizing people for differences based on race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, and disability, we still routinely deny equal treatment to people who refuse to downplay differences along these lines. At the same time, Yoshino is responsive to the American exasperation with identity politics, which often seems like an endless parade of groups asking for state and social solicitude. He observes that the ubiquity of covering provides an opportunity to lift civil rights into a higher, more universal register. Since we all experience the covering demand, we can all make common cause around a new civil rights paradigm based on our desire for authenticity—a desire that brings us together rather than driving us apart. Praise for Covering “Yoshino argues convincingly in this book, part luminous, moving memoir, part cogent, level-headed treatise, that covering is going to become more and more a civil rights issue as the nation (and the nation’s courts) struggle with an increasingly multiethnic America.”—San Francisco Chronicle “[A] remarkable debut . . .

Quotable Kids : Fun in the Family Tree (Sibling Revelry and Parent 'Releaf'),"Kendallville, Ind. -- Kids turning your life upside down? There's ""releaf"" when you turn to the humor in the family tree. Award-winning journalist Grace Witwer Housholder has assembled her best funny kids stories regarding family humor into a new gift book called: ""Quotable Kids -- Fun in the Family Tree"". The 144-page book has an eye-catching upside down design because kids can turn life upside down. ""Quotable Kids"" is actually two books in one: Sibling Revelry and Parent 'Releaf.' Housholder compares humor to the leaves on a tree. ""Leaves enable trees to grow and flourish"", she writes. ""Leaves provide refreshing shade on hot days. That's the way laughter and humor work. Laughter refreshes, reduces stress, increases creativity and builds stronger relationships. Laughter cools us down when we are about to boil over. Humor helps us to grow and flourish.."". The book, beautifully illustrated by award-winning artist Debbie Rittenhouse, a pastor's wife and mother of four, includes a special section for families to write in their favorite stories and create a keepsake volume. ""Quotable Kids"" is the fourth book published by The Funny Kids Project. Volumes 1,2 and 3 of ""The Funny Things Kids Say"" contain hundreds of the best stories submitted to Housholder, who has been collecting them since 1987. Her funny kids columns appear in several newspapers, regional magazines and Internet newsletters.

Criminal Justice,"In his impassioned-yet-measured book, Rafael A. Mangual offers an incisive critique of America's increasingly radical criminal justice reform movement, and makes a convincing case against the pursuit of ""justice"" through mass-decarceration and depolicing. After a summer of violent protests in 2020—sparked by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Rayshard Brooks—a dangerously false narrative gained mainstream acceptance: Criminal justice in the United States is overly punitive and racially oppressive. But, the harshest and loudest condemnations of incarceration, policing, and prosecution are often shallow and at odds with the available data. And the significant harms caused by this false narrative are borne by those who can least afford them: black and brown people who are disproportionately the victims of serious crimes. In Criminal (In)Justice, Rafael A. Mangual offers a more balanced understanding of American criminal justice, and cautions against discarding traditional crime control measures. A powerful combination of research, data-driven policy journalism, and the author's lived experiences, this book explains what many reform advocates get wrong, and illustrates how the misguided commitment to leniency places America's most vulnerable communities at risk. The stakes of this moment are incredibly high. Ongoing debates over criminal justice reform have the potential to transform our society for a generation—for better or for worse. Grappling with the data—and the sometimes harsh realities they reflect—is the surest way to minimize the all-too-common injustices plaguing neighborhoods that can least afford them.",['Rafael A.

Environmental Management in the Tropics: An Historical Perspective,"The arrival of western science and economic interests to the tropics has dramatically changed the tropical environment and its ecology. Environmental Management in the Tropics discusses the ecology of the tropics and examines how it is different from the temperate zone where western science evolved. The author discusses how native people traditionally subsisted in different ecological zones of the tropics and how they rationalized their relationship. The author also takes a critical look at the impact of colonialism in the tropics and how it changed traditional cultures and their relationship with the environment. The current clash between economics and ecology in the tropics is explored in depth. According to the author, we are now able to draw ""a line in the sand"" and illustrate the consequences of continuing current practices. Environmental Management in the Tropics shows how this situation developed and discusses how the two opposing concepts must be brought back into harmony. The book is one of the few studies to take a truly interdisciplinary approach combining the serious inevitabilities of natural science with the variables of history, culture, politics, and economics. It gives us a new respect for the past and tradition of the tropics and clearly spells out why dramatic changes must occur to prevent further degradation of the tropical environment. Environmental Management in the Tropics is an important reference for ecologists, conservationists, scientists, researchers, environmental consultants, land managers and developers, members of the world regulatory community, and anyone working on projects in tropical regions.",['Randall Baker'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FwSbzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FwSbzQEACAAJ&dq=Environmental+Management+in+the+Tropics:+An+Historical+Perspective&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,CRC Press,2020-12-18,http://books.google.com/books?id=FwSbzQEACAAJ&dq=Environmental+Management+in+the+Tropics:+An+Historical+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api,,

The Mourning Sexton: A Novel of Suspense,"In this deft, multilayered thriller, a disgraced lawyer trying to revive his tattered career stumbles across a hidden case of cold-blooded murder and discovers that he must pursue justice even though doing so might just cost him what little he has left—possibly even his life. Attorney David Hirsch was the managing partner of one of St. Louis’s most prestigious law firms, until he was convicted of embezzlement and sent to the federal penitentiary for seven years. He emerges from prison humbled and genuinely contrite, eager to patch things up with his estranged daughter and to build up a modest legal practice. In forging his life afresh, Hirsch has rediscovered his Judaism and has become part of the daily minyan, the group of ten men necessary to pray together, at the synagogue near his home. When an elderly man in the group asks for his help with a product liability case involving his daughter’s death, Hirsch reluctantly takes it on—only to discover that the seemingly straightforward lawsuit conceals a cold-blooded murder. With the help of Dulcie Lorenz, the altruistic, public-spirited attorney the dead woman worked for, Hirsch pursues the liability case while quietly amassing evidence against the highly placed person he suspects of murder. His attempt to bring his powerful adversary to justice draws Hirsch into a fierce, seesawing battle of wits—and ultimately to an act that expresses the true depth of his atonement. A page-turner in the tradition of Scott Turow, The Mourning Sexton goes beyond the question of “who done it” to explore the more intriguing questions of why the crime was committed and what it reveals about human nature. Set against the richly textured backdrops of St. Louis’s legal establishment and the city’s tight-knit Jewish community, and animated by a vivid cast of characters, it marks the debut of an extraordinary new talent.",['Michael Baron'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ezQgAzrt9QcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ezQgAzrt9QcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Mourning+Sexton:+A+Novel+of+Suspense&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Doubleday,2005-04-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ezQgAzrt9QcC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

Mein Kampf: My Struggle,"‘MEIN KAMPF’ is the autobiography of Adolf Hitler gives detailed insight into the mission and vision of Adolf Hitler that shook the world. This book is the merger of two volumes. The first volume of MEIN KAMPF’ was written while the author was imprisioned in a Bavarian fortress. The book deals with events which brought the author into this blight. It was the hour of Germany’s deepest humiliation, when Napolean has dismembered the old German Empire and French soldiers occupied almost the whole of Germony. The books narrates how Hitler was arrested with several of his comrades and imprisoned in the fortress of Landsberg on the river Lech. During this period only the author wrote the first volume of MEIN KAMPF. The Second volume of MEIN KAMPF was written after release of Hitler from prison and it was published after the French had left the Ruhr, the tramp of the invading armies still echoed in German ears and the terrible ravages had plunged the country into a state of social and economic Chaos. The beauty of the book is, MEIN KAMPF is an historical document which bears the emprint of its own time. Moreover, Hitler has declared that his acts and ‘public statements’ constitute a partial revision of his book and are to be taken as such. Also, the author has translated Hitler’s ideal, the Volkischer Staat, as the People’s State. The author has tried his best making German Vocabulary easy to understand.

Country poems,"A new collection about violence and the rural Midwest from a poet whose first book was hailed as “memorable” (Stephanie Burt, Yale Review) and “impressive” (Chicago Tribune) Flyover Country is a powerful collection of poems about violence: the violence we do to the land, to animals, to refugees, to the people of distant countries, and to one another. Drawing on memories of his childhood on a dairy farm in Illinois, Austin Smith explores the beauty and cruelty of rural life, challenging the idea that the American Midwest is mere “flyover country,” a place that deserves passing over. At the same time, the collection suggests that America itself has become a flyover country, carrying out drone strikes and surveillance abroad, locked in a state of perpetual war that Americans seem helpless to stop. In these poems, midwestern barns and farmhouses are linked to other lands and times as if by psychic tunnels. A poem about a barn cat moving her kittens in the night because they have been discovered by a group of boys resonates with a poem about the house in Amsterdam where Anne Frank and her family hid from the Nazis. A poem beginning with a boy on a farmhouse porch idly swatting flies ends with the image of people fleeing before a drone strike. A poem about a barbwire fence suggests, if only metaphorically, the debate over immigration and borders. Though at times a dark book, the collection closes with a poem titled “The Light at the End,” suggesting the possibility of redemption and forgiveness. Building on Smith’s reputation as an accessible and inventive poet with deep insights about rural America, Flyover Country also draws profound connections between the Midwest and the wider world.",['Austin Smith'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yXOYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=yXOYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Country+poems&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Princeton University Press,2018-10-02,http://books.google.com/books?id=yXOYDwAAQBAJ&dq=Country+poems&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],
The Great Famine and Beyond : Irish Migrants in Britain in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries,"""The Great Famine (1845-51) looms large in the popular imagination of Irish migration and has a profound influence on the way the history of the Diaspora is written. This is hardly surprising, for, in a little over a decade, more than two million people disappeared from Ireland with over half of them emigrating. This exodus was greater than the total number of those who had left in the previous 250 years. The Great Famine and Beyond offers a bold and original re-examination of Irish migrants in modern Britain.

God Game,"""Smart, propulsive and gripping, THE GOD GAME is an ambitious thriller and a terrifying examination of what could--and probably already is--happening in the world of artificial intelligence.""—Harlan Coben, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Run Away A technological thriller with an all-too-believable premise, award-winning author Danny Tobey's The God Game follows five teenagers obsessed with an online video game that connects them to their worst impulses and most dangerous desires. They call themselves the Vindicators. Targeted by bullies and pressured by parents, these geeks and gamers rule the computer lab at Turner High School. Wealthy bad boy Peter makes and breaks rules. Vanhi is a punk bassist at odds with her heritage. Kenny's creativity is stifled by a religious home life. Insecure and temperamental, Alex is an outcast among the outcasts. And Charlie, the leader they all depend on, is reeling from the death of his mother, consumed with reckless fury. They each receive an invitation to play The God Game. Created by dark-web coders and maintained by underground hackers, the video game is controlled by a mysterious artificial intelligence that believes it is God. Obey the almighty A.I. and be rewarded. Defiance is punished. Through their phone screens and high-tech glasses, Charlie and his friends see and interact with a fantasy world superimposed over reality. The quests they undertake on behalf of ""God"" seem harmless at first, but soon the tasks have them questioning and sacrificing their own morality. High school tormentors get their comeuppance. Parents and teachers are exposed as hypocrites. And the Vindicators' behavior becomes more selfish and self-destructive as they compete against one another for prizes each believes will rescue them from their adolescent existence. But everything they do is being recorded. Hooded and masked thugs are stalking and attacking them. ""God"" threatens to expose their secrets if they attempt to quit the game. And losing the game means losing their lives. You don't play the Game.

Contains Waldo and Magic, Inc. Waldo North Power-Air is in trouble. Their aircraft are crashing at an alarming rate, and no one can figure out the cause. Desperate for an answer, they turn to Waldo, a crippled genius who lives in a zero-g home in orbit around Earth. But Waldo has little reason to want to help the rest of humanity—until he learns that the solution to Earth’s problems also hold the key to his own. Magic, Inc. Under the guise of an agency for magicians, Magic, Inc. systematically squeezed out the small independent magicians. But one man stands firm. And with the help of an Oxford-educated African shaman and a little old lady adept at black magic, he is willing to take on the demons of Hell to resolve the problem—once and for all!

Yan, devoted to his career as a means of restoring the respect his family lost during the Cultural Revolution, needs outside help if he is to break the case.

The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy,"""[A] passionate, compelling, and disturbing argument that the ills of democracy in the United States today arise from the default of its elites."" —John Gray, New York Times Book Review (front-page review) In a front-page review in the Washington Post Book World, John Judis wrote: ""Political analysts have been poring over exit polls and precinct-level votes to gauge the meaning of last November's election, but they would probably better employ their time reading the late Christopher Lasch's book."" And in the National Review, Robert Bork says The Revolt of the Elites ""ranges provocatively [and] insightfully."" Controversy has raged around Lasch's targeted attack on the elites, their loss of moral values, and their abandonment of the middle class and poor, for he sets up the media and educational institutions as a large source of the problem. In this spirited work, Lasch calls out for a return to community, schools that teach history not self-esteem, and a return to morality and even the teachings of religion. He does this in a nonpartisan manner, looking to the lessons of American history, and castigating those in power for the ever-widening gap between the economic classes, which has created a crisis in American society. The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy is riveting social commentary.",['Christopher Lasch'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RKuYjUeiCWgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=RKuYjUeiCWgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Revolt+of+the+Elites+and+the+Betrayal+of+Democracy&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,W.

Grace and glory / E.L. Mascall ;,"Charles Miller's rigorous and sensitive examination of Richard Hooker's theology makes a valuable addition to the field of study of the cleric, one of the founding theologians of modern Anglicanism. Miller examines Hooker's works in detail, leading the reader through different facets of his vision of God: creation, Scripture, the sacraments, and practices of Christian devotion. Hooker's theology challenges an increasingly time-bound, relativistic approach to doctrine and truth; his sources were as wide, as ancient, and as modern as Hooker could make them. Miller's thoughtful analysis is informed throughout by an understanding of the context of Hooker's theological development against the backdrop of continental Calvinism and the remnants of Roman Catholicism in England. The growth of interest in Hooker among specialists has been accompanied by an abandonment of the serious study of Hooker's thought among theological students, clergy and theologians. Miller's work addresses thislack; Hooker's insights must not be forgotten in the daily distribution of theological food to Christian people. A study which attunes readers to Hooker's particular theological 'voice' and teaches its value both in his own context and as a present-day interlocutor, this volume will be of great interest to Christians and theological students alike.",['Charles Miller'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i-bkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=i-bkDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA121&dq=Grace+and+glory+/+E.L.+Mascall+%3B&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,ISD LLC,2013-07-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i-bkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],1.0

And yet, with an eye toward the French Revolution and its regicides and deicides, he shows how inevitably the course of revolution leads to tyranny.

One Hand Clapping,"Sometimes when I'm at work and waiting for customers I think about the two of us living like kings and not bothering about the future. Because there may not be any future to bother about, you know. Not for anybody, one of these days. And it's a wicked world. Average couple Janet and Howard's lives begin to unravel when Howard's photographic memory helps win him a gameshow fortune. Janet doesn't want their lives to change that much. She's quite happy working at the supermarket, cooking for her husband three times a day and watching quiz shows in the evening. But once Howard unleashes his photographic brain on the world, the once modest used-car salesman can't seem to stop. And what he sees as the logical conclusion to his success isn't something Janet can agree to. Burgess's 1961 darkly comic satire of drab English consumerism is adapted for the stage by Lucia Cox.

Conformed To His Image,"What does a relationship with God look like and how do we obtain it? It is vital for church leaders to grapple seriously with this question, for pat answers no longer suffice. Lives well-lived, not just words eloquently spoken, must become our response. The quality of our relationship with God is what will influence the health, potency, and witness of the church in an increasingly complex and hostile world. Designed for use as a college or seminary course, Conformed to His Image helps us build our lives on a fully biblical perspective. Exploring twelve approaches to Christian spirituality in depth, Dr. Kenneth Boa corrects our tendency to pick and compartmentalize. Pointing the way instead to an integrative, whole-life approach, Dr. Boa shows how each spiritual paradigm discussed is just one important facet in the gem of authentic and powerful New Testament living. With chapter overviews and objectives, questions for personal application, a glossary, and a list of key terms, Conformed to His Image will prove a defining text for the student, pastor, and church leader of today . . . and tomorrow. 12 Facets of the Complete Christian Life Relational Spirituality: Loving God Completely, Ourselves Correctly, and Others Compassionately Paradigm Spirituality: Cultivating an Eternal versus a Temporal Perspective Disciplined Spirituality: Engaging in the Historical Differences Exchanged Life Spirituality: Grasping Our True Identity in Christ Motivated Spirituality: A Set of Biblical Incentives Devotional Spirituality: Falling in Love with God Holistic Spirituality: Every Component of Life under the Lordship of Christ Process Spirituality: Being versus Doing, Process versus Product Spirit-Filled Spirituality: Walking in the Power of the Spirit Warfare Spirituality: The World, the Flesh, and the Devil Nurturing Spirituality: A Lifestyle of Discipleship and Evangelism Corporate Spirituality: Encouragement, Accountability, and Worship",['Kenneth D.

"Jacques, the fatalist, and his master","Denis Diderot (1713-1784) was among the greatest writers of the Enlightenment, and in Jacques the Fatalist he brilliantly challenged the artificialities of conventional French fiction of his age. Riding through France with his master, the servant Jacques appears to act as though he is truly free in a world of dizzying variety and unpredictability. Characters emerge and disappear as the pair travel across the country, and tales begin and are submerged by greater stories, to reveal a panoramic view of eighteenth-century society. But while Jacques seems to choose his own path, he remains convinced of one philosophical belief: that every decision he makes, however whimsical, is wholly predetermined. Playful, picaresque and comic, Diderot's novelis a compelling exploration of Enlightment philosophy. Brilliantly original in style, it is one of the greatest precursors to post-modern literature.",['Denis Diderot'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rrf_eSfyE-kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rrf_eSfyE-kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jacques,+the+fatalist,+and+his+master&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Penguin UK,2006-07-27,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rrf_eSfyE-kC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],4.0

But before Jon can declare his love for his soul mate, he is kidnapped, and his plans for a normal life are permanently dashed. Four years later, Jon reappears. He is different now: bigger, stronger, and with no memory of the time he was gone. Jon wants to pick up where he and Chloe left off—until the horrifying instant he realizes he possesses strange powers that pose a grave threat to everyone he cares for. Afraid of hurting Chloe, Jon runs away, embarking on a journey for answers. Meanwhile, in Providence, Rhode Island, healthy college students and townies with no connection to one another are inexplicably dropping dead. A troubled detective prone to unexplainable hunches, Charles “Eggs” DeBenedictus suspects there’s a serial killer at work. But when he starts asking questions, Eggs is plunged into a shocking whodunit he never could have predicted.

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY REAL SIMPLE “Providence is a novel that doesn’t fit into one box—it’s tender and dark, eerie and cool, heartbreaking but also an affirmation of the power of love.

Thumbsucker: A Novel,"This eighties-centric, Ritalin-fueled, pitch-perfect comic novel by a writer to watch brings energy and originality to the classic Midwestern coming-of-age story.Meet Justin Cobb, ""the King Kong of oral obsessives"" (as his dentist dubs him) and the most appealingly bright and screwed-up fictional adolescent since Holden Caulfield donned his hunter's cap. For years, no remedy--not orthodontia, not the escalating threats of his father, Mike, a washed-out linebacker turned sporting goods entrepreneur, not the noxious cayenne pepper-based Suk-No-Mor--can cure Justin's thumbsucking habit.Then a course of hypnosis seemingly does the trick, but true to the conservation of neurotic energy, the problem doesn't so much disappear as relocate. Sex, substance abuse, speech team, fly-fishing, honest work, even Mormonism--Justin throws himself into each pursuit with a hyperactive energy that even his daily Ritalin dose does little to blunt.Each time, however, he discovers that there is no escaping the unruly imperatives of his self and the confines of his deeply eccentric family. The only ""cure"" for the adolescent condition is time and distance.Always funny, sometimes hilariously so, occasionally poignant, and even disturbing, deeply wise on the vexed subject of fathers and sons, Walter Kirn's Thumbsucker is an utterly fresh and all-American take on the painful process of growing up.",['Walter Kirn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mdKjGwyy2ZMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mdKjGwyy2ZMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Thumbsucker:+A+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Anchor,2012-10-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mdKjGwyy2ZMC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],7.0

The Poems of Alexander Pope: A reduced version of the Twickenham Text,"A splendid presentation of Pope’s poems, excluding only his translations of Homer, this is the only one-volume edition that can lay claim to completeness and accuracy of text. It presents the corpus of Pope’s poetry as printed in the highly praised Twickenham Edition, except for the 1712 version of The Rape of the Lock and other early versions of phrases preserved in the critical apparatus of the six-volume work. Pope’s own notes to his poems are included, as well as a generous selection of the copious annotation in the Twickenham text. This reduced version of the unsurpassed standard edition of Pope will be of great value to all students and teachers of English literature. John Butt, Regius Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature at Edinburgh University, is general editor of the Twickenham Edition. ""The publishers are surely right in claiming that 'this should for long remain the standard one-volume edition of Pope's poems.'

Seamus O'Malley is a bodyguard and assassin in the outrageously powerful Dryco organisation, and he's in deep trouble. Taking the job sounded like a good idea at the time. Falling in love with his employer's mistress, Avalon, probably wasn't so bright. Getting caught up in the Dryden family's crazy rivalries didn't help. Agreeing to murder the Old Man was plain stupid.

You start with an idea, a description of the term you're looking for, and the Illustrated Reverse Dictionary leads you through associated words to the exact one you want. Moreover, each synonym is defined, and you get antonyms (word opposites) and etymologies (word histories), which a thesaurus does not offer.

China's Legalists: The Earliest Totalitarians and Their Art of Ruling (New Studies in Asian Culture),"This text discusses the Chinese Legalists, an ancient school of Chinese philosophy which flourished during the Period of the Hundred Contending Schools (6th-3rd century B.C.E.) The school perfected the science of government and art of statecraft to a level that would have greatly impressed Machiavelli. This period and its personalities, as well as a taste of the style and spirit of the Legalists' discourse, are made accessible to the student and general reader, placing into focus the roots of the great Chinese philosophy-as-statecraft tradition. The Legalists - most famously Li Kui, Shang Yang, Shen Buhai, Shen Dao, and Han Fei - had a great impact not only on the institutions and practices of Chinese imperial tradition but also on the Maoist totalitarianism of the People's Republic of China.",['Zhengyuan Fu'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7YQYDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=7YQYDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=China%27s+Legalists:+The+Earliest+Totalitarians+and+Their+Art+of+Ruling+(New+Studies+in+Asian+Culture)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2016-09-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7YQYDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],
Carriers in Combat: The Air War at Sea,"Since World War II, there have been no engagements between carrier air groups, but flattops have been prominent and essential in every war, skirmish, or terrorist act that could be struck from planes at sea. Carriers have political boundaries. They range at will with planes that can be refueled in the air to strike targets thousands of miles inland. From the improvised wooden platforms of the early 20th century to today's nuclear-powered supercarriers, Hearn explores how combat experience of key individuals drove the development, technology, and tactics of carriers in the world's navies. In the early 20th century, during the days of the dreadnaughts, innovators in Europe and North America began to fly contraptions made from wood, canvas, wire, and a small combustion engine. Naval officers soon wondered whether these rickety bi-planes could be launched from the deck of a surface vessel. Trials began from jury-rigged wooden platforms built upon the decks of colliers. The experiments stimulated enough interest for the navies of the world to begin building better aircraft and better aircraft carriers. The novelty of a ship that could carry its own airstrip anywhere on the world's oceans caught fire in the 1920s and helped induce a new arms race. While the rest of the world viewed carriers as defensive weapons, Japan focused on offensive capabilities and produced the finest carrier in the world by 1940. World War II would see the carrier emerge as the greatest surface ship afloat. Since then, no war has been fought without them.",['Chester G.

Home Buyer's Checklist: Everything You Need to Know--but Forget to Ask--Before You Buy a Home,"Everyone who has bought a home knows that an official inspection is no guarantee against unpleasant surprises, and that, ultimately, the burden to ask the important questions about the physical aspects of a home is on the home buyer. But buying a home is one of life’s most stressful, emotionally fraught activities, and it’s easy to see why many home buyers fail to anticipate the kinds of exasperating and expensive problems that can crop up after closing. Written by bestselling real estate author (more than 1 million books sold) Robert Irwin, Home Buyer's Checklist levels the playing field by equipping home buyers with a comprehensive list of questions pertaining to all the physical aspects of a house that may not be covered in an official inspection. From basement to attic, pantry to lawn, Bob walks readers through every room, nook, cranny, closet and keep, asking important questions about windows, screens, doors and door frames, fireplaces, light fixtures, moldings, and much, much more. And, drawing upon his many years of experience in the business, he provides pointers on how to deal with each problem, including information on how much it will cost to fix, how to estimate its short- and long-term consequences, how it should impact on the negotiating process, and more.",['Robert Irwin'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T2y-ej_V4fgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=T2y-ej_V4fgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Home+Buyer%27s+Checklist:+Everything+You+Need+to+Know--but+Forget+to+Ask--Before+You+Buy+a+Home&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,McGraw Hill Professional,2001-09-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T2y-ej_V4fgC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],

"The Remarkable World of Frances Barkley, 1769-1845","Frances Barkley was just eighteen when she became the first European woman to set foot on the west coast of North America. After a sheltered upbringing in England, Frances found herself boarding the Imperial Eagle in 1786 to set sail on an adventurous, round-the-world voyage with her husband, Captain Charles William Barkley. With great wisdom and wit, Frances recounted her eight years at sea in her Reminiscences as she found herself in a wider world, helping her husband in his business, giving birth to her children, surviving the tragedy of a young daughter's death and meeting strange and foreign peoples. Today's place names of Barkley Sound, Frances Island, Imperial Eagle Channel and others on Vancouver Island-as well as the ship Frances Barkley-are standing memorials to the enterprising and courageous Barkleys. Originally researched by writer Beth Hill, The Remarkable World of Frances Barkley has been expanded on by writer and historian Cathy Converse to bring the intrepid young bride and her world to life for a new generation of readers.","['Beth Hill', 'Cathy Converse']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4tEOmz-Z5q0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=4tEOmz-Z5q0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Remarkable+World+of+Frances+Barkley,+1769-1845&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",TouchWood Editions,2011-07-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4tEOmz-Z5q0C&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Love at Goon Park: Harry Harlow and the Science of Affection,"In the early twentieth century, affection between parents and their children was discouraged—psychologists thought it would create needy kids, and doctors thought it would spread infectious disease. It took a revolution in psychology to overturn these beliefs and prove that touch ensures emotional and intellectual health. In Love at Goon Park, Pulitzer Prize winner Deborah Blum charts this profound cultural shift by tracing the story of Harry Harlow—the man who studied neglect and its life-altering consequences on primates in his lab.

KARANKAWAY COUNTRY,"Roy Bedichek spent most of his life working in the educational field in Texas, but his main interest was always the great outdoors. His first book, Adventures with a Texas Naturalist, was published when he was almost seventy, and his second, Karánkaway Country, appeared three years later. Both were the result of a lifetime of exploring a beloved land, of searching observation, of discussion, debate, wide reading, and reflection. Long out of print, Karánkaway Country is now available in a handsome second edition with a new Foreword by W. W. Newcomb, Jr. Karánkaway Country focuses on the natural history of a strip of coastal prairie lying roughly between Corpus Christi and Galveston and once inhabited by the poorly known and much maligned Karankawa Indians. It serves as home base for an exposition of Bedichek's philosophy, providing a convenient local setting for richly tailored essays on wildlife, soil, human skin, and a variety of other topics suggested by a wide-ranging intellect.

Poetry and Experience,"This is the fifth volume in a six-volume translation of the major writings of Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911), a philosopher and historian of culture who has had a significant, and continuing, influence on twentieth-century Continental philosophy and in a broad range of scholarly disciplines. In addition to his landmark works on the theories of history and the human sciences, Dilthey made important contributions to hermeneutics and phenomenology, aesthetics, psychology, and the methodology of the social sciences. This volume presents Dilthey's principal writings on aesthetics and the philosophical understanding of poetry, as well as representative essays of literary criticism. The essay ""The Imagination of the Poet"" (also known as his Poetics) is his most sustained attempt to examine the philosophical bearings of literature in relation to psychological and historical theory. Also included are ""The Three Epochs of Modern Aesthetics and its Present Task,"" ""Fragments for a Poetics,"" and two final essays discussing Goethe and Hölderlin. The latter are drawn from Das Erlebnis und die Dichtung, a volume that was acclaimed on publication as a classic of literary criticism and that continues to be a model for the geistesgeschichtliche approach to literary history.",['Wilhelm Dilthey'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HbMtMFSyBA8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HbMtMFSyBA8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Poetry+and+Experience&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Princeton University Press,1985,http://books.google.com/books?id=HbMtMFSyBA8C&dq=Poetry+and+Experience&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],

The Scoreless Thai,"Evan Tanner can't sleep. Ever. Which gives him plenty of free time to get involved in lots of interesting endeavors in all sorts of exotic locales. Now Tanner's in Thailand with a partially baked plan and a butterfly net, hoping to snare a beautiful missing chanteuse who's metamorphosed into an international jewel thief. Tanner hopes everyone will buy his disguise as a rare butterfly researcher. And everyone does . . . Except the guerilla band holding him captive. They intend to remove his head when the sun rises, so Tanner must put his fate in the hands of a randy Thai youth who will do anything for a woman, even set a suspected spy free.

The way,"Spanning nearly 50 years of family history, the book chronicles the remarkable lives of two creative talents, Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. It's a story of father and son set against the backdrop of Hollywood; this narrative is organized around their physical and spiritual journey along the Camino de Santiago, Spain, the thousand-year-old pilgrimage path which traverses Galicia. It is the area from which Sheen's father emigrated to the U.S. and to which Estevez's own son has returned. Along the Waywill focus not just on the lives these men have chosen as artists, but also (and most importantly) on the one they have lived together. It is a story of family bonds and artistic advances and setbacks; of good choices and hard choices; of opportunities lost and opportunities found. Sheen and Estevez will share what they have experienced and learned from each other in their forty eight years as father and son, as fathers of sons, as actors and director, as spiritual seekers, and as concerned citizens of the world. Readers will meet them as real people rather than icons, as two men who have accumulated decades of wisdom and insight they are now ready to share.","['Martin Sheen', 'Emilio Estevez']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X5EeoIqmjvAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=X5EeoIqmjvAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+way&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2012-05-10,http://books.google.com/books?id=X5EeoIqmjvAC&dq=The+way&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],7.0

Travels with Charley,"A collectible 50th anniversary deluxe edition featuring an updated introduction by Jay Parini and first edition cover art and illustrated maps of Steinbeck’s route by Don Freeman A Penguin Classic In September 1960, John Steinbeck embarked on a journey across America. He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante. His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York. Travels with Charley in Search of America is an intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his life—a self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the South—which Steinbeck witnessed firsthand—Travels with Charley is a stunning evocation of America on the eve of a tumultuous decade. This Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition also features French flaps and deckle-edged paper. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Machik's Complete Explanation: Clarifying the Meaning of Chod (Tsadra Foundation),"Fear, anger, and negativity are states that each of us have to contend with. Machik's Complete Explanation, the most famous book of the teachings of Machik Lapdrön, the great female saint and yogini of eleventh- to twelfth-century Tibet, addresses these issues in a practical, direct way. Machik developed a system, the Mahamudra Chöd, that takes the Buddha's teachings as a basis and applies them to the immediate experiences of negative mind states and malignant forces. Her unique feminine approach is to invoke and nurture the very ""demons"" that we fear and hate, transforming those reactive emotions into love. It is the tantric version of developing compassion and fearlessness, a radical method of cutting through ego-fixation. This expanded edition includes Machik Lapdrön's earliest known teaching, the original source text for the tradition, The Great Bundle of Precepts on Severance (Chöd). This pithy set of instructions reveals that the teachings of the perfection of wisdom are the true inspiration for Chöd. It is beautifully clarified in a short commentary by Rangjung Dorje, the Third Karmapa.",['Sarah Harding'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j7xvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=j7xvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Machik%27s+Complete+Explanation:+Clarifying+the+Meaning+of+Chod+(Tsadra+Foundation)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Shambhala Publications,2013-05-14,http://books.google.com/books?id=j7xvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Machik%27s+Complete+Explanation:+Clarifying+the+Meaning+of+Chod+(Tsadra+Foundation)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

The French Founders of North America and Their Heritage,"No era in American history has been more fascinating to Americans, or more critical to the ultimate destiny of the United States, than the colonial era. Between the time that the first European settlers established a colony at Jamestown in 1607 through the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the outlines of America's distinctive political culture, economic system, social life, and cultural patterns had begun to emerge. Designed to complement the high school American history curriculum as well as undergraduate survey courses, ""Colonial America: An Encyclopedia of Social, Political, Cultural, and Economic History"" captures it all: the people, institutions, ideas, and events of the first three hundred years of American history. While it focuses on the thirteen British colonies stretching along the Atlantic, Colonial America sets this history in its larger contexts. Entries also cover Canada, the American Southwest and Mexico, and the Caribbean and Atlantic world directly impacting the history of the thirteen colonies. This encyclopedia explores the complete early history of what would become the United States, including portraits of Native American life in the immediate pre-contact period, early Spanish exploration, and the first settlements by Spanish, French, Dutch, Swedish, and English colonists. This monumental five-volume set brings America's colonial heritage vibrantly to life for today's readers. It includes: thematic essays on major issues and topics; detailed A-Z entries on hundreds of people, institutions, events, and ideas; thematic and regional chronologies; hundreds of illustrations; primary documents; and a glossary and multiple indexes.",['James Ciment'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VDiPDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=VDiPDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT990&dq=The+French+Founders+of+North+America+and+Their+Heritage&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2016-09-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VDiPDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],

Maid of honor,"Please read before you buy!!! If you've been asked to be a maid of honor (or matron of honor), first of all, congrats! This is a big honor and can be fun and exciting. Just in case you aren't clear on the definition, the maid of honor is defined as the bride's right-hand woman throughout her engagement and wedding day, leading the rest of the bridesmaids in their own duties. The bride will typically tap her BFF, sibling, or another close friend to serve in this important role, because of the wide range of hats, a maid of honor will have to wear: confidant, assistant, the voice of reason, shoulder to cry on, if needed, as well as bridesmaid leader (and sometimes wrangler). As such, there are a slew of maid of honor duties and responsibilities that fall under the MOH's purview. So what does a maid of honor do, exactly? In response to all the complaints in your comments, here are the sections I included in the book: Maid of honor duties before the wedding Maid of honor duties before/during/after the ceremony Maid of honor duties during/after the reception Instructions and tips about MOH speech/bachelorette party/bridal shower/games and more Monthly planner Weekly planner one week before the big day Wedding day timeline Blank pages for notes and memories Thank you so much for all your reviews, I do really appreciate all your comments as it helps me to provide better quality for you.

"Army Generals and Reconstruction: Louisiana, 1862-1877","The U.S. Army faced extraordinary problems while policing the post-Civil War South, and the task may have been most difficult in Louisiana, where Reconstruction lasted longer than in any other of the former Confederate states. Beginning with General Benjamin Franklin Butler, who boasted that ""in six months New Orleans should be a Union city or - a home of the alligators"", the Union generals who commanded Louisiana met with varying degrees of success in their attempts to enforce the constantly evolving Reconstruction policies of three administrations on a people who openly despised their conquerors. Covering the period from the fall of New Orleans to Federal forces through the collapse of Stephen Packard's Republican government in 1877, Army Generals and Reconstruction, by Joseph G. Dawson III, is a history and a detailed analysis of the army's responsibilities, accomplishments, and failures in Reconstruction Louisiana. Dawson shows how the decisions and attitudes of the army commanders were crucial to both the Republican and Democratic parties and how neither side could act confidently without knowing first how the generals would respond to their actions.

Return to Nisa,"The story of two women--one a hunter-gatherer in Botswana, the other an ailing American anthropologist--this powerful book returns the reader to territory that Marjorie Shostak wrote of so poignantly in the now classic Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman. Here, however, the ground has perceptibly shifted. First published in 1981, Nisa served as a stirring introduction to anthropology's most basic question: Can there be true understanding between people of profoundly different cultures? Diagnosed with breast cancer, and troubled by a sense of work yet unfinished, Shostak returned to Botswana in 1989. This book tells simply and directly of her rediscovery of the !Kung people she had come to know years before--the aging, blunt, demanding Nisa, her stalwart husband Bo, understanding Kxoma, fragile Hwantla, and Royal, translator and guide. In Shostak's words, we clearly see !Kung life, the dry grasslands, the healing dances, the threatening military presence. And we see Shostak herself, passionately curious, reporting the discomforts and confusion of fieldwork along with its fascination. By turns amused and frustrated, she describes the disappointments--and chastening lessons--that inevitably follow when anthropologists (like her younger self) romanticize the !Kung. Throughout, we observe a woman of threatened health but enormous vitality as she pursues the promise she once discovered in the !Kung people and, above all, in Nisa. At the core of the book is the remarkable relationship between these two women from different worlds. They are often caught off guard by the limits of their mutual understanding. Still, their determination to reach out to each other lingers in the reader's mind long after the story ends--providing an eloquent response to questions that Nisa so memorably posed. It was not that we had become the best of friends or like close family. It was simply that she and I had the most straightforward connection I had ever had with anyone, before or since. It was as if the !Kung culture and my talks with Nisa touched something beyond reason in me. Even though I didn't necessarily like everything Nisa said, nor everything about her, my heart had been captured. But how often I wished Nisa had been more noble, more selfless, and more philosophical. Nisa had to be known well to be appreciated, for she was complex and difficult. She probably would say much the same about me. We both wanted things from each other, and neither of us got as much as we hoped for. That we both got some of what we wanted--well, that made our friendship extremely valuable. --from the Epilogue",['Marjorie Shostak'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U5SCpadLfoYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=U5SCpadLfoYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Return+to+Nisa&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harvard University Press,2009-06-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=U5SCpadLfoYC&dq=Return+to+Nisa&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],3.0

"The Complete Poems of Francis Thompson (Modern Library, 38.2)","John Merbecke (c.1505-c.1585) is most famous as the composer of the first musical setting of the English liturgy, The Booke of Common Praier Noted (BCPN), published in 1550. Not only was Merbecke a pioneer in setting English prose to music but also the compiler of the first Concordance of the whole English Bible (1550) and of the first English encyclopaedia of biblical and theological studies, A Booke of Notes and Common Places (1581). By situating Merbecke and his work within a broader intellectual and religio-cultural context of Tudor England, this book challenges the existing studies of Merbecke based on the narrow theological approach to the Reformation. Furthermore, it suggests a re-thinking of the prevailing interpretative framework of Reformation musical history. On the basis of the new contextual study of Merbecke, this book seeks to re-interpret his work, particularly BCPN, in the light of humanist rhetoric. It sees Merbecke as embodying the ideal of the 'Christian-musical orator', demonstrating that BCPN is an Anglican epitome of the Erasmian synthesis of eloquence, theology and music. The book thus depicts Merbecke as a humanist reformer, through re-evaluation of his contributions to the developments of vernacular music and literature in early modern England. As such it will be of interest, not only to church musicians, but also to historians of the Reformation and students of wider Tudor culture.",['Hyun-Ah Kim'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TusoDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=TusoDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA211&dq=The+Complete+Poems+of+Francis+Thompson+(Modern+Library,+38.2)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Routledge,2016-05-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TusoDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],

"The Divine Initiative : Grace, World-Order, and Human Freedom in the Early Writings of Bernard Lonergan (Lonergan Studies)","Bernard Lonergan spent much of his early career grappling with Thomas Aquinas' monumental effort at 'thinking out the Christian universe.' What he learned from Aquinas reinforced the basis of a theological paradigm whose main lines would remain intact throughout all of his subsequent work. The Divine Initiative explores Lonergan's comprehensive position on the doctrines of grace and providence formulated in his early writings, paying particular attention to the unpublished treatise De ente supernaturali (On Supernatural Being). J. Michael Stebbins' investigation uncovers a theological synthesis of remarkable assimilative capacity. A key to Lonergan's position is his sophisticated understanding of the structured but dynamic process that characterizes the order of the created universe. Lonergan characterizes grace as a particular instance of God's providential activity in human living and in the cosmos as a whole. On the strength of his inquiries into Aquinas' positions on the meaning of causality, free will, sin, and divine transcendence, Lonergan explains why God's governance of all created activity is compatible with the contingence of created events in general and with human freedom in particular.

Emerson's essay on compensation;,"Ever since I was a boy, I have wished to write a discourse on Compensation: for it seemed to me when very young, that on this subject life was ahead of theology, and the people knew more than the preachers taught. The documents, too, from which the doctrine is to be drawn, charmed my fancy by their endless variety, and lay always before me, even in sleep; for they are the tools in our hands, the bread in our basket, the transactions of the street, the farm, and the dwelling-house, greetings, relations, debts and credits, the influence of character, the nature and endowment of all men. It seemed to me, also, that in it might be shown men a ray of divinity, the present action of the soul of this world, clean from all vestige of tradition, and so the heart of man might be bathed by an inundation of eternal love, conversing with that which he knows was always and always must be, because it really is now. It appeared, moreover, that if this doctrine could be stated in terms with any resemblance to those bright intuitions in which this truth is sometimes revealed to us, it would be a star in many dark hours and crooked passages in our journey that would not suffer us to lose our way.Ralph Waldo EmersonLife Transformation Publishing / www.lifetransformationpublishing.com selected this book to publish because it was recommended by Napaloeon Hill who wrote Think and Grow Rich of which we have published also.

Silvermeadow,"Two Cases. One location. The first case, a girl gone missing, seems a decidedly local affair. The second, the return of a violent criminal who had fled the country, instantly attracts the interest of Scotland Yard and Detective Inspector David Brock. When he learns that his longtime nemesis, the amphetamine-juiced killer and thief known as “Upper” North, may have surfaced, Brock assembles his team and summons Detective Sergeant Kathy Kolla. Their manhunt centers on Silvermeadow, the supermall on the outskirts of London where North was spotted. Brock and Kolla camouflage their search for North by taking on the case of the missing girl—a mall employee. They lie in wait, hoping to catch North before he can strike with a new crime. Yet what should they make of rumors of other young girls disappearing from Silvermeadow? Is there a predator on the loose within the apparent safety of a carefully orchestrated aura of order and control? Very quickly, the mall itself—and its colorful cast of characters—becomes key to the dual investigations.

Norito,"This book presents, for the first time, a collection of ancient Japanese Shinto prayers in a format where English speaking readers can both understand the deep meaning of the translated text and can also pronounce the original Japanese words. Shinto is an ancient spiritual tradition, primarily practiced in Japan, which is now spreading its traditions to the western world. Its primordial rituals and traditions touch a deep chord within one's spiritual self. Shinto's focus on divinity of all beings and of all creation, on living with gratitude and humility, and on purification and lustration of one's self and environment will bring light and joy to any reader. The purpose of prayer and ritual as practiced in the Shinto tradition, is to reinsert ourselves into a divine state of being, not as a new position, but as an acknowledgement and reinforcement of what already exists. Ritual restores sensitive awareness to our relationship to the universe. Through purification and removal of impurities and blockages, we return to our innate internal brightness and cultivate a demeanor of gratitude and joy. Shinto rituals and prayers were created by ancient man over 2,000 years ago in a time when mankind was more intuitive about his relationship to this world. Because of this, the rites are archetypal and invoke deep emotion within the participants. This book of prayers will introduce the western reader to the deep spirituality of Shinto, providing explanation of the spiritual tradition and practice and providing a collection of 22 prayers for use in personal meditation and devotions.

My Struggle for Freedom: Memoirs,"Hans Kung is undoubtedly one of the most important theologians of our time, but he has always been a controversial figure, and as the result of a much-publicized clash over papal infallibility had his permission to teach revoked by the Vatican. Yet at seventy-five years of age Kung is also something of a senior statesman, one of the -Group of Eminent Persons convened by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and a friend of heads of government like Britain's Tony Blair and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. In this fascinating autobiography Kung gives a frank and outspoken account of the first four decades of his life. He tells of his youth in Switzerland and his decision to become a priest, of his doubts and struggles as he studied in Rome and Paris, and of his experiences as a professor in Tubingen, where he received a chair at the early age of thirty-one. Most importantly, as one of the last surviving eyewitnesses of Vatican II, Kung gives an authentic account of the conflicts behind the scenes. Here it becomes clear just how major an influence he was, to the point of shaping the Council's agenda and drafting speeches for bishops to deliver in plenary sessions. Kung's book offers an acute analysis, compelling in its drama, of meetings with presidents like John F. Kennedy, popes like John XXIII and Paul VI, great theologians like Karl Barth and Karl Rahner, and journeys around the world. With its rich thought and vivid narrative, it paints a moving picture of Kung's personal convictions, including his relentless struggle for a Christianity characterized not by the domination of an official church but by Jesus.","['Hans Kung', 'Hans Küng']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M6Hm-VmD6_sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=M6Hm-VmD6_sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=My+Struggle+for+Freedom:+Memoirs&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Wm.

A Day with Picasso,"In 1978, while collecting documentary photographs of the artists' community in Montparnasse from the first decades of the century, Billy Klüver discovered that some previously unassociated photographs fell into significant groupings. One group in particular, showing Picasso, Max Jacob, Moïse Kisling, Modigliani, and others at the Café de la Rotonde and on Boulevard du Montparnasse, all seemed to have been taken on the same day. The people were wearing the same clothes in each shot and had the same accessories. Their ties were knotted the same way and their collars had the same wrinkles. A total of twenty-four photographs—four rolls of film with six photographs each—were eventually found. With the challenge of identifying the date, photographer, and circumstances, Klüver embarked on an inquiry that would illuminate the minute texture of that time and place. Biographical research into the subjects' lives led Klüver to focus on the summer of 1916 as the likely time the photos were taken. He then measured buildings and plotted angles and lengths of shadows in the photographs to narrow the time frame to a spread of three weeks. Further investigation eventually allowed Klüver to identify the photographer as Jean Cocteau and to determine the day that Cocteau had taken the photographs: August 12, 1916. A computer printout of the sun's positions on that date, obtained from the Bureau des Longitudes, together with the length of the shadows, enabled Klver to calculate the time of day of each photograph, and thus to put them in proper sequence. In a tour de force of art historical research, Klüver then reconstructed a scenario of the events of the four hours depicted in the photographs. With evocative attention to detail—noting when Picasso is no longer carrying an envelope or Max Jacob has acquired a decoration in his lapel—Klüver recreates a single afternoon in the lives of Picasso and friends, a group of remarkable people in early twentieth-century Paris. Besides the central ""portfolio"" of photographs by Cocteau, the book contains additional photographs and drawings, short biographies of all the subjects, and a historical section on the events and activities in the Paris art world at the time.",['Billy Kluver'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ir1NEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ir1NEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Day+with+Picasso&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,MIT Press,1999-02-18,http://books.google.com/books?id=ir1NEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Day+with+Picasso&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Art'],

Home for the Holidays,"""Sara Richardson writes unputdownable, unforgettable stories from the heart"" in this emotional holiday novel, where three sisters have one last Christmas to confront their pasts before their lives change forever (Jill Shalvis, New York Times bestselling author). The Buchanan sisters all share special childhood memories of their Aunt Sassy's beloved Juniper Inn. There, they frolicked in the snow, baked sugar cookies, and celebrated the town's annual Christmas extravaganza. They haven't been back to Colorado in nearly fifteen years, but when their aunt invites them for one last Christmas, they can't say no . . . With her ex-husband whisking her children away for the holiday, Dahlia decides it's time to do something for herself. Juniper Springs is just as beautiful as she remembers, but it's also full of surprises -- including the town's handsome doctor, who makes her feel like herself again for the first time in years. To the outside world, baker Magnolia has the ideal marriage. Only the pain and sorrow of infertility have strained her relationship with her husband, perhaps beyond repair. But a holiday miracle is about to change her life. After a whirlwind romance, youngest sister Rose is about to be married, but as the wedding draws near, she's unsettled by her fiancé's expectations that she become a society wife. Spending Christmas with her family could be a necessary reality check -- or the beginning of a brand-new happily ever after. Thanks to the strength of their sisterhood, some mistletoe, and the love of their Aunt Sassy, the Buchanan sisters will discover what it is they truly want this Christmas.",['Sara Richardson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g37IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=g37IDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Home+for+the+Holidays&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Forever,2020-09-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g37IDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],
Southern Railways Spencer Shops: 1896-1996,"Curt Tillotson, Jr. takes a close and personal look at the Southern Railway through his own photography in the period 1960-1982, with some photos from others going back to about 1950. He treats every class of diesel owned by the Southern from beginning to end. Some ""roster"" or ""portrait"" type photos are included but the bulk of the book comprises superb action photography with the locomotives and trains in a variety of settings. His extended captions capture the feel of the era of transition. Anyone interested in railroads of the Southeastern United States will be interested in this volume.

The Feast of Roses: A Novel,"The love story of Emperor Jahangir and Mehrunnisa, begun in the critically praised debut novel The Twentieth Wife, continues in Indu Sundaresan's The Feast of Roses. This lush new novel tells the story behind one of the great tributes to romantic love and one of the seven wonders of the world -- the Taj Mahal. Mehrunnisa, better known as Empress Nur Jahan, comes into Jahangir's harem as his twentieth and last wife. Almost from the beginning of her royal life she fits none of the established norms of womanhood in seventeenth-century India. Mehrunnisa is the first woman Jahangir marries for love, at the ""old"" age of thirty-four. He loves her so deeply that he eventually transfers his powers of sovereignty to her. Power and wealth do not come easily to Mehrunnisa -- she has to fight for them. She has a formidable rival in the imperial harem, Empress Jagat Gosini, who has schemed and plotted against Mehrunnisa from early on. Mehrunnisa's problems do not just lie within the harem walls, but at court, too, as she battles powerful ministers for supremacy. These ministers, who have long had Emperor Jahangir's confidence and trust, consider Mehrunnisa a mere woman who cannot have a voice in the outside world. Mehrunnisa combats all of this by forming a junta of sorts with three men she can rely on -- her father, her brother, and Jahangir's son Prince Khurram. She demonstrates great strength of character and cunning to get what she wants, sometimes at a cost of personal sorrow when she almost loses her daughter's love. But she never loses the love of the man who bestows this power upon her -- Emperor Jahangir. The Feast of Roses is a tale of this power and love, the story of power behind a veil.",['Indu Sundaresan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LAIN1cOlEVsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LAIN1cOlEVsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Feast+of+Roses:+A+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2003-05-27,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LAIN1cOlEVsC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],11.0
Banking on Reform: Political Parties and Central Bank Independence in the Industrial Democracies (Michigan Studies in International Political Economy),"Banking on Reform examines the political determinants of recent reforms to monetary policy institutions in the industrial democracies. With these reforms, political parties have sought to draw on the political credibility of an independent central bank to cope with electoral consequences of economic internalization and deindustrialization. New Zealand and Italy made the initial efforts to grant their central banks independence. More recently, France, Spain, Britain, and Sweden have reformed their central banks' independence. Additionally, members of the European Union have implemented a single currency, with an independent European central bank to administer monetary policy. Banking on Reform stresses the politics surrounding the choice of these institutions, specifically the motivations of political parties. Where intraparty conflicts have threatened the party's ability to hold office, politicians have adopted an independent central bank. Where political parties have been secluded from the political consequences of economic change, reform has been thwarted or delayed. The drive toward a single currency also reflects these political concerns. By delegating monetary policy to the European level, politicians in the member states removed a potentially divisive issue from the domestic political agenda, allowing parties to rebuild their support constructed on the basis of other issues. William T. Bernhard provides a variety of evidence to support his argument, such as in-depth case accounts of recent central bank reforms in Italy and Britain, the role of the German Bundesbank in the policy process, and the adoption of the single currency in Europe. Additionally, he utilizes quantitative and statistical tests to enhance his argument. This book will appeal to political scientists, economists, and other social scientists interested in the political and institutional consequences of economic globalization. William T. Bernhard is Assistant Professor of Political Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.",['William T.

Born To Sing: Vocal Technique Vocal Style (Revised),"Since the eighteenth century, the one-to-one singing lesson has been the most common method of delivery. The scenario allows the teacher to familiarise and individualise the lesson to suit the needs of their student; however, it can also lead to speculation about what is taught. More troubling is the heightened risk of gossip and rumour with the private space generating speculation about the student–teacher relationship. Venanzio Rauzzini (1746–1810), an Italian castrato living in England who became a highly sought-after singing master, was particularly susceptible since his students tended to be women, whose moral character was under more scrutiny than their male counterparts. Even so in 1792, The Bath Chronicle proclaimed the Italian castrato: 'the father of a new style in English singing'. Branding Rauzzini as a founder of an English style was not an error, but indicative of deep-seated anxieties about the Italian invasion on England’s musical culture. This book places teaching at the centre of the socio-historical narrative and provides unique insight into musical culture. Using a microhistory approach, this study is the first to focus in on the impact of teaching and casts new light on issues of celebrity culture, gender and nationalism in Georgian England.",['Brianna E.

Clean & Simple 2 - the Sequel,"Named a Best Book of 2020 by NPR and Vanity Fair One of Smithsonian's Ten Best Science Books of 2020 “A searching and vital explication of germ theory, social norms, and what the modern era is really doing to our bodies and our psyches.” —Vanity Fair A preventative medicine physician and staff writer for The Atlantic explains the surprising and unintended effects of our hygiene practices in this informative and entertaining introduction to the new science of skin microbes and probiotics. Keeping skin healthy is a booming industry, and yet it seems like almost no one agrees on what actually works. Confusing messages from health authorities and ineffective treatments have left many people desperate for reliable solutions. An enormous alternative industry is filling the void, selling products that are often of questionable safety and totally unknown effectiveness. In Clean, doctor and journalist James Hamblin explores how we got here, examining the science and culture of how we care for our skin today. He talks to dermatologists, microbiologists, allergists, immunologists, aestheticians, bar-soap enthusiasts, venture capitalists, Amish people, theologians, and straight-up scam artists, trying to figure out what it really means to be clean. He even experiments with giving up showers entirely, and discovers that he is not alone. Along the way, he realizes that most of our standards of cleanliness are less related to health than most people think. A major part of the picture has been missing: a little-known ecosystem known as the skin microbiome—the trillions of microbes that live on our skin and in our pores. These microbes are not dangerous; they’re more like an outer layer of skin that no one knew we had, and they influence everything from acne, eczema, and dry skin, to how we smell. The new goal of skin care will be to cultivate a healthy biome—and to embrace the meaning of “clean” in the natural sense. This can mean doing much less, saving time, money, energy, water, and plastic bottles in the process. Lucid, accessible, and deeply researched, Clean explores the ongoing, radical change in the way we think about our skin, introducing readers to the emerging science that will be at the forefront of health and wellness conversations in coming years.",['James Hamblin'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BK2-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=BK2-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Clean&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2020-07-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BK2-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Health & Fitness'],5.0

The Hidden Treasure,"The tale begins over three-hundred years ago, when the Fair People—the goblins, fairies, dragons, and other fabled and fantastic creatures of a dozen lands—fled the Old World for the New, seeking haven from the ways of Man. With them came their precious jewels: diamonds, rubies, emeralds, pearls... But then the Fair People vanished, taking with them their twelve fabulous treasures. And they remained hidden until now... Across North America, these twelve treasures, over ten-thousand dollars in precious jewels in 1982 dollars, are buried. The key to finding each can be found within the twelve full-color paintings and verses of THE SECRET. Are you smart enough? THE SECRET: A TREASURE HUNT was published in 1982. The year before publication, the author and publisher Byron Preiss had traveled to 12 locations in the continental U.S. (and possibly Canada) to secretly bury a dozen ceramic casques. Each casque contained a small key that could be redeemed for one of 12 jewels Preiss kept in a safe deposit box in New York.

Swim to the Top: Arthur Lydiard Takes to the Water,"New Zealand swimming coach David Wright sought the help of running guru Arthur Lydiard to gain better results. He had already used Lydiard's endurance training schedules while living and working in England to establish his wife, Alison, as one of New Zealand's premier middle-distance runners, and wondered how Lydiard's methods could be applied in the swimming pool. For nearly a decade, Wright and Lydiard, collaborating every week, experimented with the conversion of long-distance aerobic endurance training, hill running, bounding and springing, steps running and sprint sharpening from the varied terrains that a runner encounters to the confines of a swimming pool's still, flat water. This volume presents the method they have developed, and is designed for all swimmers, beginners and advanced, who are looking for new ways in swimming training.","['David Wright', 'Garth Gilmour']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dio4NQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Dio4NQAACAAJ&dq=Swim+to+the+Top:+Arthur+Lydiard+Takes+to+the+Water&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Meyer & Meyer Verlag,2002-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=Dio4NQAACAAJ&dq=Swim+to+the+Top:+Arthur+Lydiard+Takes+to+the+Water&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Sports & Recreation'],

Latin American Law: A History of Private Law and Institutions in Spanish America,"Private law touches every aspect of people's daily lives—landholding, inheritance, private property, marriage and family relations, contracts, employment, and business dealings—and the court records and legal documents produced under private law are a rich source of information for anyone researching social, political, economic, or environmental history. But to utilize these records fully, researchers need a fundamental understanding of how private law and legal institutions functioned in the place and time period under study. This book offers the first comprehensive introduction in either English or Spanish to private law in Spanish Latin America from the colonial period to the present. M. C. Mirow organizes the book into three substantial sections that describe private law and legal institutions in the colonial period, the independence era and nineteenth century, and the twentieth century. Each section begins with an introduction to the nature and function of private law during the period and discusses such topics as legal education and lawyers, legal sources, courts, land, inheritance, commercial law, family law, and personal status. Each section also presents themes of special interest during its respective time period, including slavery, Indian status, codification, land reform, and development and globalization.",['M. C.

Nothing's Sacred,"Comedian Lewis Black unleashes his trademark subversive wit while recounting his own life story in his New York Times bestselling memoir. You've seen him on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart offering up his trademark angry observational humor on everything from politics to pop culture. You've seen his energetic stand-up performances on HBO, Comedy Central, and in venues across the globe. Now, for the first time, Lewis Black translates his volcanic eruptions into book form in Nothing's Sacred, a collection of rants against stupidity and authority, which oftentimes go hand in hand. With subversive wit and intellectual honesty, Lewis examines the events of his life that shaped his antiauthoritarian point of view and developed his comedic perspective. Growing up in 1950s suburbia when father knew best and there was a sitcom to prove it, he began to regard authority with a jaundiced eye at an early age. And as that sentiment grew stronger with each passing year, so did his ability to hone in on the absurd. True to form, he puts common sense above ideology and distills hilarious, biting commentary on all things politically and culturally relevant. ""No one is safe from Lewis Black's comic missiles.""

Wittgenstein's Vienna Revisited,"Fin de siecle Vienna was once memorably described by Karl Kraus as a ""proving ground for the destruction of the world."" In the decades leading to the World War that brought down the Austro-Hungarian empire, the city was at once an operetta dream world masking social and political problems and tension, as well as a center for the far-reaching explorations and innovations in music, art, science, and philosophy that would help to define modernity. One of the most powerful critiques of the retreat into fantasy was that of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose early career in Vienna has helped frame debates about ethical and aesthetic values in culture. In Wittgenstein's Vienna Revisited Allan Janik expands upon his work Wittgenstein's Vienna (co-authored with Stephen Toulmin) to amplify a number of significant points concerning the genesis of Wittgenstein's thought, the nature of Viennese culture, and criticism of contemporary culture. Although Wittgenstein is the central figure in this volume, Janik places considerable emphasis on other influential figures, both Viennese and non-Viennese, in order to break down some of the persistent stereotypes about the philosopher and his surrounding culture, especially the myths of ""carefree"" Vienna and Wittgenstein the positivist. The persistence of these myths, in Janik's view, stems in part from the inability of many historians to differentiate past from present in the evaluation of intellectual currents. Janik reviews a number of figures overlooked in assessing Wittgenstein: Otto Weininger, Kraus, Schoenberg, Nietzsche, Wagner, Ibsen, Offenbach, and Georg Trakl. All of these, Janik demonstrates, are absolutely necessary to understand what was at stake in the debates on aestheticism and the critique of a modern culture. Wittgenstein's efforts to recognize the limits of thought and language and thus to be fair to science, religion, and art account for his place of honor among critical modernists. These essays elucidate Wittgenstein's perspective on our culture.",['Allan Janik'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZyFWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZyFWDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Wittgenstein%27s+Vienna+Revisited&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2018-04-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZyFWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],

Syriac New Testament-FL-Peshitta,"An approach to Jesus’s recorded words and teachings through his native language, Aramaic, answers many questions clearly and consistently, even if unexpectedly, no matter which Gospel you have in your hands. From the Introduction: “The challenges we face today are not in essence different from those of our ancestors: relationships, love, knowledge, work, and purpose still claim our main attention. Yet the implications of these challenges for the survival of humanity and the planet seem more acute. We seem to know more, yet our consciousness has evolved in such a way that makes it difficult to see what the purpose of life really is. How do we live more fully in the moment, solving the problems before us? “Jesus’s teachings have been used historically to fuel what became modern Western culture, with all its pluses and minuses. At the same time, viewed through his native language, the same teachings provide a solution to our culture’s greatest challenges, pointing the way toward a proper use of our human individuality and will.” Through expansions of Aramaic’s multiple meanings as well as guided contemplations, Revelations of the Aramaic Jesus provides a guide to transformation through the way of the prophet of Nazareth. It shows how Jesus’s deepest teachings address contemporary challenges, such as our relationships with nature and each other, as well as the purpose of life itself. Revelations of the Aramaic Jesus looks at frequently asked questions such as: Is Jesus talking about a personal God or an impersonal one? Or both? What did the words blessing, grace, and happiness mean to Yeshua, and what do they mean for us today? How do evil and injustice fit into Jesus’s view of life? And what is his remedy? Revelations of the Aramaic Jesus is a guide to living an authentic interior life without dogma and a spiritual path that makes you more comfortable in your own, providing a sense of meaning and purpose.",['Neil Douglas-Klotz'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=edNgEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=edNgEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA235&dq=Syriac+New+Testament-FL-Peshitta&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hampton Roads Publishing,2022-10-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=edNgEAAAQBAJ&dq=Syriac+New+Testament-FL-Peshitta&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

Finding Purpose in Your Pain,"For I know the plans I have for you,"" says the LORD. ""They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope."" NLT (Jeremiah 29:11). This does not mean that life will be easy, in fact living in your purpose can be exactly the opposite. Filled with pain and struggles and doing things that you don't want to do, but there is purpose in your pain. Just as our DNA and our fingerprints are unique to each one of us, we are also unique beings when it comes to our journey, purpose, and destiny. God has a specific plan and purpose for each one of us. Our life, circumstances, physical features, and personality have all been put in place for us to fulfill our purpose. God is intentional and makes no mistakes. Romans 8:28 says ""And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them."" NLT Unfortunately, we often lose sight of this and become frustrated when life happens. The struggles, hardships, loses, and pain we experience begin to weigh us down. We lose hope and want to throw in the towel, but it is when we are at our weakest that God does his best work. It is often through the trials and tribulations that we begin to walk in our purpose. These situations build character and strength, but more importantly it builds our Faith.

Poetry and the Age,"About Poetry and the Age: ""Perhaps the most comprehensive and certainly the most detailed of all studies of modern poetry.""-- Delmore Schwartz, New York Times Book Review ""Randall Jarrell's book about poetry and the criticism of poetry pulls the bung-cork out of the barrel. The reader is exhilarated, led on to agree with Mr. Jarrell joyfully, even to cap his opinions--and at last to grow reckless. . . . Poetry and the Age is enormously readable.""-- Louis Simpson, The American Scholar ""The most powerful reviewer of poetry active in this country for the last decade. . . . Everybody interested in modern poetry ought to be grateful to him."" -- John Berryman, New Republic Randall Jarrell was the critic whose taste defined American poetry after World War II. Poetry and the Age, his first collection of criticism, was published in 1953. It has been in and out of print over the past 40 years and has become a classic of American letters. In this new edition, two long-lost lectures by Jarrell have been added. Recently discovered by critics, they speak to issues at the heart of Jarrell's criticism: the structure of poetry and the question ""Is American poetry American?"" One of the outstanding poets of the postwar generation, Jarrell was also celebrated for his extraordinary praise of some underappreciated older and younger poets and for his witty dismissals of current favorites he thought less qualified. Poetry and the Age includes groundbreaking considerations of Walt Whitman and Robert Frost as well as profound appraisals of Wallace Stevens, Marianne Moore, John Crowe Ransom, and William Carlos Williams. His early reviews that established the reputations of Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop are here, beside other enthusiastic discoveries that have withstood the test of time. Poetry and the Age also contains Jarrell's influential essays on the obscurity of poetry and on the age of criticism, essays that offer some of the most relevant and readable literary judgments of the 20th century. Randall Jarrell (1914-1965) wrote eight books of poetry, five anthologies, four children's books illustrated by Maurice Sendak, four translations, including Faust: Part I and The Three Sisters (performed on Broadway by the Actor's Studio), and a novel, Pictures from an Institution. He received the National Book Award for poetry in 1960, served as poet laureate at the Library of Congress in 1957 and 1958, and taught for many years at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro. He was a member of the American Institute of Arts and Letters.",['Randall Jarrell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cxOcQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cxOcQgAACAAJ&dq=Poetry+and+the+Age&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2001,http://books.google.com/books?id=cxOcQgAACAAJ&dq=Poetry+and+the+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],1.0

"Monks, Rulers, and Literati: The Political Ascendancy of Chan Buddhism","The Chan (Zen in Japanese) school began when, in seventh-century China, a small religious community gathered around a Buddhist monk named Hongren. Over the centuries, Chan Buddhism grew from an obscure movement to an officially recognized and eventually dominant form of Buddhism in China and throughout East Asia. It has reached international popularity, its teachings disseminated across cultures far and wide. In Monks, Rulers, and Literati, Albert Welter presents, for the first time in a comprehensive fashion in a Western work, the story of the rise of Chan, a story which has been obscured by myths about Zen. Zen apologists in the twentieth century, Welter argues, sold the world on the story of Zen as a transcendental spiritualism untainted by political and institutional involvements. In fact, Welter shows that the opposite is true: relationships between Chan monks and political rulers were crucial to Chan's success. The book concentrates on an important but neglected period of Chan history, the 10th and 11th centuries, when monks and rulers created the so-called Chan ""golden age"" and the classic principles of Chan identity. Placing Chan's ascendancy into historical context, Welter analyzes the social and political factors that facilitated Chan's success as a movement. He then examines how this success was represented in the Chan narrative and the aims of those who shaped it. Monks, Rulers, and Literati recovers a critical period of Zen's past, deepening our understanding of how the movement came to flourish. Welter's groundbreaking work is not only the most comprehensive history of the dominant strand of East Asian Buddhism, but also an important corrective to many of the stereotypes about Zen.",['Asian Religions University of Winnipeg Albert Welter Professor'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0D0IUv8NeWMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=0D0IUv8NeWMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Monks,+Rulers,+and+Literati:+The+Political+Ascendancy+of+Chan+Buddhism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","Oxford University Press, USA",2006-01-11,"http://books.google.com/books?id=0D0IUv8NeWMC&dq=Monks,+Rulers,+and+Literati:+The+Political+Ascendancy+of+Chan+Buddhism&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Religion'],

Bodies of Water,"*LAMBDA Literary Award Finalist* Alternating between past and present, a forbidden love story blooms in the sexually oppressive early-1960's in T. Greenwood's shimmering, haunting novel that explores the nature of memory, aging, feminism, lust, and most importantly, love in a tumultuous era. In this deeply tender novel, acclaimed novelist T. Greenwood moves deftly between the past and present to create a poignant and wonderfully moving story of friendship, the resonance of memories, and the love that keeps us afloat. In 1960, Billie Valentine is a young housewife living in a sleepy Massachusetts suburb, treading water in a dull marriage and caring for two adopted daughters. Summers spent with the girls at their lakeside camp in Vermont are her one escape--from her husband's demands, from days consumed by household drudgery, and from the nagging suspicion that life was supposed to hold something different. Then a new family moves in across the street. Ted and Eva Wilson have three children and a fourth on the way, and their arrival reignites long-buried feelings in Billie. The relationship that deepens between the two women offers a solace Billie has never known, until their secret is revealed and both families are wrenched apart in the tragic aftermath. Fifty years later, Ted and Eva's son, Johnny, contacts an elderly but still spry Billie, entreating her to return east to meet with him. Once there, Billie finally learns the surprising truth about what was lost, and what still remains, of those joyful, momentous summers.",['T.

Knowledge of Meaning: An Introduction to Semantic Theory,"Many textbooks in formal semantics are all versions of, or introductions to, the same paradigm in semantic theory: Montague Grammar. Knowledge of Meaning is based on different assumptions and a different history. It provides the only introduction to truth-theoretic semantics for natural languages, fully integrating semantic theory into the modern Chomskyan programme in linguistic theory and connecting linguistic semantics to research elsewhere in cognitive psychology and philosophy. As such, it better fits into a modern graduate or undergraduate programme in linguistics, cognitive science, or philosophy.

Historical Dictionary of U.S.-Latin American Relations,"From the assertion of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 to the Reagan Doctrine of the 1980s, the United States has presumed a position of political leadership and pre-eminence in the Western Hemisphere. This has been made possible by two main factors: America's huge economy, which has made the U.S. the largest single commercial market and the biggest investor in Latin America, and America's military prowess, which has been convincingly demonstrated in victories in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848) and the Spanish-American War (1898). This volume concentrates on the history of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the nations of Latin America from the creation of the independent United States in the late eighteenth century up to the present. This is accomplished through a chronology, an introduction, a bibliography, appendixes, and hundreds of cross-referenced dictionary entries on the countries involved, significant events, major crises, important figures, controversial issues, and doctrines and policies that have evolved. For scholars, historians, and students interested in the diplomacy of these two regions, the Historical Dictionary of United States-Latin American Relations is an essential reference.",['Joseph Smith'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WPu12Sb62BEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=WPu12Sb62BEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Historical+Dictionary+of+U.S.-Latin+American+Relations&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Scarecrow Press,2006-12-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WPu12Sb62BEC&source=gbs_api,['History'],

The Manual of Below-Grade Waterproofing Systems,"The ever evolving technology of waterproofing presents challenges and risks for architects and engineers who do not specialize in the field. The revised edition of The Manual of Below-Grade Waterproofing Systems provides the education and product information to enable designers to take a sound, fundamental approach to these contemporary challenges. Building designers specify waterproofing systems and materials that are often based on limited and subjective manufacturers’ literature or past experience with systems that work under specific conditions, but will fail in other installations. Leakage usually leads to litigation. This book gives you the tools to prevent that. This manual covers the history and science of waterproofing materials, the considerable distinctions between waterproofing roofs and plazas and below-grade surfaces, the critical procedures for protecting waterproofing materials during construction, diagnosing and remediating leaks, writing specifications, and detailing waterproofing components.

Further Than Passion,"Kate Duncan agrees to help her young cousin land a husband though she draws the line when she learns the foolish girl wants to use an apothecary's love potion to snag the notorious Marcus Pelham! To prove the elixir a fake, Kate drinks it herself-and experiences the most erotic moment of her life when she stumbles upon Marcus in a most compromising position. Every nerve in Kate's body sings as she watches from the shadows, but is her response a result of the potion...or the man? Luckily, Marcus is far too busy to notice Kate's spying-or so she thinks... As the Earl of Stamford, Marcus has his choice of willing ladies to share his bed. Yet nothing has ever aroused him as much as the image of Kate watching him. Marcus tries to have a little fun with Kate by drinking the elixir-and then appearing to lose all control every time she's near. But the prank goes awry when Marcus finds himself wildly and truly attracted to the innocent Kate. As he teaches her the passionate art of seduction, will he lose his heart for the very first time?",['Cheryl Holt'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gmawl3bz-PAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Gmawl3bz-PAC&pg=PA177&dq=Further+Than+Passion&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Paperbacks,2007-04-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gmawl3bz-PAC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],

The New Oxford Book of Carols,"Edited by early music experts Hugh Keyte and Andrew Parrott, this anthology of Christmas carols is the most comprehensive collection ever made, spanning seven centuries of caroling in Britain, continental Europe, and North America. Containing music and text of 201 carols, many in more than one setting, the book is organized in two sections: composed carols, ranging from medieval Gregorian chants to modern compositions, and folk carols, including not only traditional Anglo-American songs but Irish, Welsh, German, Czech, Polish, French, Basque, Catalan, Sicilian, and West Indian songs as well. Each carol is set in four-part harmony, with lyrics in both the original language and English. Accompanying each song are detailed scholarly notes on the history of the carol and on performance of the setting presented. The introduction to the volume offers a general history of carols and caroling, and appendices provide scholarly essays on such topics as fifteenth-century pronunciation, English country and United States primitive traditions, and the revival of the English folk carol. The Oxford Book of Carols, published in 1928, is still one of Oxford's best-loved books among scholars, church choristers, and the vast number of people who enjoy singing carols. This volume is not intended to replace this classic but to supplement it. Reflecting significant developments in musicology over the past sixty years, it embodies a radical reappraisal of the repertory and a fresh approach to it. The wealth of information it contains will make it essential for musicologists and other scholars, while the beauty of the carols themselves will enchant general readers and amateur songsters alike.","['Hugh Keyte', 'Andrew Parrott', 'Clifford Bartlett']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hksJAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=hksJAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+New+Oxford+Book+of+Carols&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,1998-10-15,http://books.google.com/books?id=hksJAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+New+Oxford+Book+of+Carols&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Music'],

Rhymes with Witches,"From the author of the break-out hit ttyl, a dark and utterly readable take on the hierarchy of high school girls. There are Gossip Girls and Mean Girls but no one has come as close to the dark heart of high-school girl politics as Lauren Myracle does in this shivery smart, wonderfully strange story of a high school where popularity can be stolen. No one notices Jane—not the jocks, the stoners, the debaters, the drama geeks, the cheerleaders, and especially not the Bitches, the school royalty made up of one girl from each class who's so transcendently beautiful and fascinating that no one can help but worship her. Imagine Jane's surprise when the Bitches approach her to be their freshman member.

C. P Cavafy Selected Poems,"C. P. Cavafy (1863-1933) lived in relative obscurity in Alexandria, and a collected edition of his poems was not published until after his death. Now, however, he is regarded as the most important figure in twentieth-century Greek poetry, and his poems are considered among the most powerful in modern European literature. Here is an extensively revised edition of the acclaimed translations of Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard, which capture Cavafy's mixture of formal and idiomatic use of language and preserve the immediacy of his frank treatment of homosexual themes, his brilliant re-creation of history, and his astute political ironies. The resetting of the entire edition has permitted the translators to review each poem and to make alterations where appropriate. George Savidis has revised the notes according to his latest edition of the Greek text. About the first edition: ""The best [English version] we are likely to see for some time.""--James Merrill, The New York Review of Books ""[Keeley and Sherrard] have managed the miracle of capturing this elusive, inimitable, unforgettable voice. It is the most haunting voice I know in modern poetry.""--Walter Kaiser, The New Republic ?","['C. P. Cavafy', 'Kōnstantinos P.

The great scholar, W. E. B. Du Bois, once wrote about the Problem of race in America, and what he called “Double Consciousness,” a sensitivity that every African American possesses in order to survive. Since childhood, Ailey Pearl Garfield has understood Du Bois’s words all too well. Bearing the names of two formidable Black Americans—the revered choreographer Alvin Ailey and her great grandmother Pearl, the descendant of enslaved Georgians and tenant farmers—Ailey carries Du Bois’s Problem on her shoulders. Ailey is reared in the north in the City but spends summers in the small Georgia town of Chicasetta, where her mother’s family has lived since their ancestors arrived from Africa in bondage. From an early age, Ailey fights a battle for belonging that’s made all the more difficult by a hovering trauma, as well as the whispers of women—her mother, Belle, her sister, Lydia, and a maternal line reaching back two centuries—that urge Ailey to succeed in their stead. To come to terms with her own identity, Ailey embarks on a journey through her family’s past, uncovering the shocking tales of generations of ancestors—Indigenous, Black, and white—in the deep South. In doing so Ailey must learn to embrace her full heritage, a legacy of oppression and resistance, bondage and independence, cruelty and resilience that is the story—and the song—of America itself.",['Honoree Fanonne Jeffers'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5VH1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5VH1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Give+Me+Songs+for+Lovers&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,HarperCollins,2021-08-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5VH1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],9.0

A Complete Introduction to Modern NMR Spectroscopy,"Clear, accessible coverage of modern NMR spectroscopy-for students and professionals in many fields of science Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has made quantum leaps in the last decade, becoming a staple tool in such divergent fields as chemistry, physics, materials science, biology, and medicine. That is why it is essential that scientists working in these areas be fully conversant with current NMR theory and practice. This down-to-basics text offers a comprehensive, up-to-date treatment of the fundamentals of NMR spectroscopy. Using a straightforward approach that develops all concepts from a rudimentary level without using heavy mathematics, it gives readers the knowledge they need to solve any molecular structure problem from a complete set of NMR data. Topics are illustrated throughout with hundreds of figures and actual spectra. Chapter-end summaries and review problems with answers are included to help reinforce and test understanding of key material. From NMR studies of biologically important molecules to magnetic resonance imaging, this book serves as an excellent all-around primer on NMR spectroscopic analysis.",['Roger S.

Every Marriage Is a Fixer-Upper: A Do-It-Yourselfer's Guide to Bringing Out the Best in Your Relationship,"In this funny and sharp romantic comedy, a woman with a knack for turning her boyfriends’ lives around starts a professional service to help wrangle men, only to be unexpectedly matched with an old flame. Ever since she can remember, Aly has been fixing everything around her: her parents’ marriage, her colleagues’ work problems, and her friends’ love lives are just a few examples. After a chance meeting with an ex who has gone from living in his parents’ basement to being a married project manager in three years, she realizes she’s been fixing her boyfriends, too.... So, Aly decides to put her talents to good use and, alongside two work friends, sets up the Fixer Upper, an exclusive, underground service for women who are tired of unpaid emotional labor. Using little tricks and tips, Aly and her friends get the men to do the work themselves—to get out of the job they hate, sign up for that growth seminar, do more parenting. Before long, a high-profile Instagram star hires them to fix up her app developer boyfriend. There’s just one catch—he’s also Aly’s childhood best friend and first love. As Aly tackles her biggest “fixer upper” yet, she’ll have to come to terms with their complicated history and figure out how much to change someone she’d always thought was perfect as he is....",['Lauren Forsythe'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cQJMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cQJMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Every+Marriage+Is+a+Fixer-Upper:+A+Do-It-Yourselfer%27s+Guide+to+Bringing+Out+the+Best+in+Your+Relationship&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2022-08-02,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cQJMEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2.0

Children Who Kill: Profiles of Pre-teen and Teenage Killers (2003),"The subject of murder has always held a particular fascination for us. But, since at least the nineteenth century, we have seen the murderer as different from the ordinary citizen—a special individual, like an artist or a genius, who exists apart from the moral majority, a sovereign self who obeys only the destructive urge, sometimes even commanding cult followings. In contemporary culture, we continue to believe that there is something different and exceptional about killers, but is the murderer such a distinctive type? Are they degenerate beasts or supermen as they have been depicted on the page and the screen? Or are murderers something else entirely? In The Subject of Murder, Lisa Downing explores the ways in which the figure of the murderer has been made to signify a specific kind of social subject in Western modernity. Drawing on the work of Foucault in her studies of the lives and crimes of killers in Europe and the United States, Downing interrogates the meanings of media and texts produced about and by murderers. Upending the usual treatment of murderers as isolated figures or exceptional individuals, Downing argues that they are ordinary people, reflections of our society at the intersections of gender, agency, desire, and violence.",['Lisa Downing'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E9YUf7Kga0QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=E9YUf7Kga0QC&pg=PA204&dq=Children+Who+Kill:+Profiles+of+Pre-teen+and+Teenage+Killers+(2003)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Chicago Press,2013-05-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E9YUf7Kga0QC&source=gbs_api,['True Crime'],

Fifty-Five Years in the Alaskan Bush: The John Swiss Story,"Over a half century ago, John Swiss acquired a remote property on the far shore of Cook Inlet 100 air miles southwest of Anchorage. Polly Creek is a place of dreams. With a backdrop of snow-draped peaks, razor clam beds stretch out from the cabin's front door, salmon race through nearby seas and fresh brown bear tracks pockmark the sand at his doorstep. Moose and bear, beaver, eagles and whales are his neighbors. Over the years, he has trapped, fished, hunted, prospected, guided and flown his way into the realm of legend. John's career as a bear guide spans Alaskan bear hunting from the immediate post war period to the present time. He has guided black and brown bear hunters for all these years and polar bear hunters for 18 of the 20 years it was a popular sport. This book is told for the most part in John's own words. John's spellbinding stories unwind slowly at first, from his upstate New York childhood. He is a true pioneer of the North and just as Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett did before him, he blazed a trail into the unknown land to the west of civilization and carved a life out of the wilderness.",['Jeff Davis'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nx-Nu5ki9FoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Nx-Nu5ki9FoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fifty-Five+Years+in+the+Alaskan+Bush:+The+John+Swiss+Story&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,iUniverse,2003-06,http://books.google.com/books?id=Nx-Nu5ki9FoC&dq=Fifty-Five+Years+in+the+Alaskan+Bush:+The+John+Swiss+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

It takes world-city and world-history literatures to a higher level of depth and understanding. It is difficult to imagine a more pioneering, in-depth study of world cities."" Ramon Grosfoguel, Professor, Department of Ethnic Studies, University of California, Berkeley ""A remarkable and original discussion of three great sacred cities across time, and their transformation by nationalism in the modern world."" Immanuel Wallerstein, Yale University Far from spawning an age of tolerance, modernity has created the social basis of division and exclusion. This book elaborates this provocative claim as it explores the rich but divided histories of three cities located at the crossroads of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Many observers presume that violence is built into these sacred cities because their citizens cling to religious or cultural ideals of some archaic age; only when this history is overcome can citizens enter a new age of brotherhood. Samman persuades us to refocus our attention on modernity, which has instilled troubling dilemmas from the outside. He shows how these sacred places long ago entered the modern world where global political and economic forces exacerbate nationalism and regional divisions. If we are to resolve deep conflicts we must re-imagine the institutional basis on which modernity, rather than religion, is built.",['Khaldoun Samman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FzweCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=FzweCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cities+of+God+And+Nationalism+Rome,+Mecca,+And+Jerusalem+As+Contested+Sacred+World+Cities&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Routledge,2015-12-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FzweCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Education'],

How To Become an Employer of Choice,"Competition among employers is fierce with many companies arguing that they have the best opportunities. The labor market has become a seller's market, with workers able to make their own choices about where they will work, how diligently they'll work and when they'll leave. ""Employer of Choice"" defines, clarifies and differentiates the term, concept and what really constitutes an Employer of Choice. This book is ground breaking, establishing a new category in the way these issues are addressed in the world of work. Aspects of being an Employer of Choice addressed in the book include the company, the culture, enlightened leadership, care of people, growth and opportunity, meaningful work, compensation and benefits, and making the world a better place.","['Roger E.

Lafcadio Hearn's Japan: An Anthology of His Writings,"This collection of writings from Lafcadio Hern paints a rare and fascinating picture of pre-modern Japan Over a century after his death, author, translator, and educator Lafcadio Hearn remains one of the best-known Westerners ever to make Japan his home. Almost more Japanese than the Japanese—""to think with their thoughts"" was his aim—his prolific writings on things Japanese were instrumental in introducing Japanese culture to the West. In this masterful anthology, Donald Richie shows that Hearn was first and foremost a reliable and enthusiastic observer, who faithfully recorded a detailed account of the people, customs, and culture of late nineteen-century Japan. Opening and closing with excerpts from Hearn's final books, Richie's astute selection from among ""over 4,000 printed pages"" not including correspondence and other writing, also reveals Hearn's later, more sober and reflective attitudes to the things that he observed and wrote about. Part One, ""The Land,"" chronicles Hearn's early years when he wrote primarily about the appearance of his adopted home. Part Two, ""The People,"" records the author's later years when he came to terms with the Japanese themselves. In this anthology, Richie, more gifted in capturing the essence of a person on the page than any other foreign writer living in Japan, has picked out the best of Hearn's evocations. Select writings include: The Chief City of the Province of the Gods Three Popular Ballads In the Cave of the Children's Ghosts Bits of Life and Death A Street Singer Kimiko On A Bridge","['Lafcadio Hearn', 'Donald Richie']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XQDCwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=XQDCwAEACAAJ&dq=Lafcadio+Hearn%27s+Japan:+An+Anthology+of+His+Writings&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Tuttle Publishing,2007-10-15,http://books.google.com/books?id=XQDCwAEACAAJ&dq=Lafcadio+Hearn%27s+Japan:+An+Anthology+of+His+Writings&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],
